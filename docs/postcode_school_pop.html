<p>In the map below, every circle represents a postcode in Brighton and Hove, sized according to the estimated number of households with dependent children living in that postcode, and coloured according to the proportion of all children in that postcode aged 0-15, living in income deprived families.</p>
<p>Hover the mouse over each dot to see the postcode and estimated counts of households with dependent children.</p>
<p>The boundaries on the map represent the current (2024/25) school catchment boundaries (blue) and the proposed 2026/27 boundaries (red) taken from the <a href="https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/apply-school/proposed-admission-arrangements-brighton-hove-schools-2026-2027#tab--catchment-area-postcode-list">Catchment Area Postcode List</a> published by Brighton and Hove District Council</p>
<p>The graphs below the map</p>
<p>These estimates use postcode level population and household estimates derived from the 2021 Census, obtained from NOMIS - <a href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_pc" class="uri">https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_pc</a></p>
<p>Details of households with dependent children taken from the 2021 Census - Table TS003 Household Composition - <a href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_bulk" class="uri">https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021_bulk</a></p>
<p>Deprivation data is taken from the 2019 Index of Multiple Deprivation - <a href="https://imd-by-geo.opendatacommunities.org" class="uri">https://imd-by-geo.opendatacommunities.org</a> - In this case I have used the <a href="https://opendatacommunities.org/def/concept/general-concepts/imd/idaci">Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index</a> - IDACI.</p>
<p>Counts of households with dependent children have been estimated using household proportions at postcode level to distribute output area level numbers of households with dependent children proportionally to each postcode in each output area.</p>
