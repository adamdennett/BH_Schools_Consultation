    "text": "During a meeting at BHCC on 19/12/2024 which included 6 members of the Parent Support Group, two Ward Councillors and members of the BHCC Schools Team, Cllr Tayor stated that the main aim of this whole Schools Admissions Process was to improve attainment in the city.\nThere is a large body of literature including recent government reports, which states unquivocally that if improving attainment is the goal, then the best way to achieve this is through reducing school absence and in particular, persistent absence.\nThis paper finds that pupil absence is the main factor driving attainment and the attainment gap in Brighton & Hove. And that the measures currently proposed by the council could make this worse rather than better.\nExploring national school-level data for 2022-23 published by the Department for Education alongside some LEA-level data going back to 2016, it is clear that Brighton and Hove has a more serious problem with persistent absence than most other local authorities in England. And it is absence over and above any other factor, including concentrations of disadvantage, that is leading to any reduced levels of attainment observed in the city.\nProblems of persistent absence are mainly concentrated in two schools - BACA and Longhill - although despite having one of the most serious problems of persistent absence of anywhere in England, BACA actually produces outcomes that are better than expected, given the chronic absence problem it faces.\nThe evidence here suggests that most of the perceived associations between disadvantage and educational attainment in Brighton are actually a mistaken conflation with persistent absence. The two can be correlated - and they are more so in Brighton than in some other places - but the correlation at the national level is weak. And at the local level, disadvantage becomes statistically insignificant in the presence of persistent absence when trying to explain attainment.\nBHCC has misdiagnosed a perceived ‘problem’ of disadvantaged attainment and has failed to even acknowledge publicly in any part of the October engagement or the latest consultation that persistent absence is the #1 problem facing the city’s schools and hindering the attainment of its pupils. Tackling this should be a priority over and above anything else.\nStatistical Analysis reveals that due to the high average levels of disadvantage in Brighton and Hove (council predicting an average of 30% FSM across schools by 2026), reductions in the % of disadvantaged students in some schools from, say from 50% to 30%, is unlikely to have a noticeable impact on either Attainment 8 or Progress 8 scores. With Attainment 8, Schools in Brighton would need to have levels of disadvantage below 15% or so to see any noticeable impact on attainment scores by reducing disadvantage concentrations further - this is not likely.\nAfter controlling for levels of persistent absence, levels of deprivation, school quality effects (proxied by Ofsted classifications) and regional effects across all state funded secondary schools in England in 2022/23, persistent absence is confirmed as the most important factor driving attainment in England. Concentrations of disadvantaged students in schools, while contributing some effect, are below school quality effects and well below the effects of absence. After controlling for these effects, BACA can be viewed as performing well above average given the challenges it faces and compared with other schools in a similarly challenging situation nationally.\nIn Brighton and Hove in 2022/23, disadvantage becomes a statistically insignificant variable in the presence of persistent absence, although the small number of data points means this needs further investigation.\nAs a consequence of misdiagnosing the problem, the treatment prescribed by the council not only fails to address the real underlying issue, but it actually stands to make it much worse. The 20% out-of-catchment open admissions criteria, if implemented, will lead to up to 30% of the City’s children having to attend a school out of catchment (20% through ‘choice’ and 10% through forced displacement).\nIf the 20% out of catchment priority is implemented then (according to figures derived from the Council Consultation papers) by 2030, some 3,234 pupils a day (out of 10,843 - 1/3) will have to travel to and from school out of catchment. Evidence from FFT education data lab using National Pupil Database data from the UK confirms that pupils who live nearest to school attend more often. Deliberately designing more travel into the school system, given the evidence presented in this piece, can only be viewed as either a conscious move to make educational outcomes for this large proportion of students in the city worse, or a total failure to understand the problem given the stated objectives.\nForced long-distance travel and the disconnection between local community, family and school is virtually guaranteed to exacerbate the attendance problem and thus drive down attainment in the city (which currently is above average).\nSerious questions need to be asked about why the most significant problem affecting attainment in the city has been completely absent in the discourse from the council. It has also been entirely absent from any of the public proclamations made by Class Divide who, given that educational attainment of disadvantaged students is their core mission and has been for a decade or so, should have been aware of this issue.\nSerious questions need to be asked about why Councillors from wards in the city which given the current school catchments, will be home to the majority of persistent absentees, are not aware of the #1 issue driving educational disadvantage in their wards, but are happy to support plans which will make the educational outcomes in their areas even worse. These wards in particular are:\n\nColden and Stanmer\nMoulscoombe and Bevendean\nWoodingdean\nWhitehawk and Marina\n\n\n\n\nIn this piece I am going to change the focus of the conversation and look at something which has thus far been absent (excuse the pun) from any of the conversations about the school system in Brighton. The issue of absence/attendance and its importance for educational outcomes.\n\n\nThe Council’s premise in the very first slide shown in the engagement exercise back in October, was that Brighton and Hove has a large attainment gap and is failing its most disadvantaged pupils. Now, I have since refuted that claim here and shown that Brighton is not performing badly as a city and indeed is above the national median in terms of disadvantaged attainment.\nHowever, it is clear that disadvantage and attainment is still an important topic for the council. Indeed Cllr Taylor confirmed as much in the presence of other councillors, council officers and the Parent Support Group saying it was his number 1 aim for this whole process.\nThis is supported in the new proposal documentation (supporting documents here) where it states in 3.7 that the council wants a system that:\n\n“delivers children’s outcomes which are good and improving especially for those at risk of disadvantage”\n\nand under 3.9 that:\n\n“the proposals put forward were designed to include: a) Better equality of outcomes – results not driven by economic advantage. b) Deliver a ‘comprehensive’ offer from our city schools as a more mixed pupil intake creates better outcomes for disadvantaged pupils.”\n\n\n\nThe underpinning assumptions in those statements above and the proposals that follow are that:\n\neconomic advantage/disadvantage are the main drivers of results in the city\nthe main remedy is through some kind of economic mixing in intakes\n\nBut in much the same way as when we go to the doctor, we expect an accurate diagnosis and corresponding efficacious treatment, we all know that unfortunately, sometimes, neither diagnosis nor treatment are correct.\nWe know the council’s prescribed treatment has been influenced quite heavily by some of the work of Stephen Gorard (https://theconversation.com/poorer-pupils-do-worse-at-school-heres-how-to-reduce-the-attainment-gap-205535) and a full paper here - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244018825171, but the effect of school level mixing, relative to other factors is small. Here is what Gorard says in the conclusions in his influential paper:\n\n“Whether school composition is a phantom or not, the school-level variables tell a consistent story across the duration of schooling. Pupils do worse in schools with clusters of disadvantage or clusters of prior attainment. Put another way, if this composition is real, then schools should be as mixed as possible both socially and academically. This could lead to improved outcomes of between 0.05 and 0.15 of a standard deviation for almost no cost.”\n\nNow this needs a bit of unpicking.\n\nGorard is not 100% confident that the school-level effect is a real one. The “Phantom” being referred to in the paper is the fact that measuring pupil-level data and characteristics could be imprecise and when aggregated up to the school level, might give misleading impressions.\nBut if we accept that it is real - and let’s just say it is - then increased mixing in schools could lead to improved outcomes of between 0.05 and 0.15 of a standard deviation - now Gorard says “for almost no cost”, perhaps a better way of phrasing this would be “assuming no cost” - as the means by which increasing mixing in schools occurs could come at quite high cost - particularly as we have seen in Brighton where the mechanism is essentially via long-distance busing of children between catchment areas. This is likely to incur quite considerable costs for children (tiredness, anxiety, reluctance to attend if school far away etc.)\nIn the case of Brighton and Hove, we can put a real number on 0.05 and 0.15 of a standard deviation in approved attainment? In 2022-23 the mean school - level Attainment 8 score was 47.56 (in England it was 45.9). The standard deviation (how much, on average, the attainment 8 scores in the city vary around that mean) was 6.92 (in England, 7.23). 0.15 (the most improvment Gorard thinks might be possible from increased mixing) of 6.92 = 1.038.\nSo if social mixing can occur at no negative cost, we might expect - at best according to the Gorard paper - a 1pt improvement in the average pupil (and I assume by extension average school-level) Attainment 8 score in 1 subject out of the 10 used to calculate the score. If no negative costs. Although it’s not clear how much of a change in the levels of mixing would be required to affect this 1pt improvement - usually these things relate to a 1-unit change in \\(x\\) (concentration of disadvantaged pupils, but this feels high and is not clear?) for a corresponding change in \\(y\\), but this is not clear in the paper.\nFor context, in Brighton and Hove in 2022-23, Attainment 8 scores at the school level ranged from 35.8 to 54.5. So the effect is at best small, and relative to the range experienced by schools in Brighton (almost 20pts), very small.\n\nSo if there are no negative costs associated with increasing social mixing (and it’s not a phantom effect), we might expect a very small positive impact on attainment by increasing mixing, but we don’t know how much additional mixing (over and above the mixing already present) will be required to reach this maximum benefit of 1 Attainment 8 point.\nIf we look at the level of mixing and segregation in Brighton’s schools already (using the Gorard Segregation Index) - see below - we can observe that Brighton and Hove is already ranked the 44th best (out of 154 LEAs) in England for its levels of disadvantaged integration, so it already has less headroom than other LEAs for improvement.\n\n\nCode\n#all england schools\nedubase_schools &lt;- read_csv(\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fhzafgt27v30lmmuo084y/edubasealldata20241003.csv?rlkey=uorw43s44hnw5k9js3z0ksuuq&raw=1\") %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  filter(phase_of_education_name == \"Secondary\") %&gt;% \n  filter(establishment_status_name == \"Open\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(urn = as.character(urn))\n\n#read in Brighton Secondary Schools Data\nbrighton_sec_schools &lt;- read_csv(\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fhzafgt27v30lmmuo084y/edubasealldata20241003.csv?rlkey=uorw43s44hnw5k9js3z0ksuuq&raw=1\") %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  filter(la_name == \"Brighton and Hove\") %&gt;% \n  filter(phase_of_education_name == \"Secondary\") %&gt;% \n  filter(establishment_status_name == \"Open\") %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(., coords = c(\"easting\", \"northing\")) %&gt;% \n  st_set_crs(27700)\n\nbtn_urn_list &lt;- brighton_sec_schools %&gt;% \n  select(urn) \n\nengland_abs &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_abs.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\nengland_census &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_census.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\nengland_ks4final &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_ks4final.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\nengland_school_information &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_school_information.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\n\nla_codes &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_metadata\", \"2022-2023\", \"la_and_region_codes_meta.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\")) %&gt;% \n  clean_names()\n\nengland_ks4final &lt;- england_ks4final %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(TOTPUPS:PTOTENT_E_COVID_IMPACTED_PTQ_EE, ~ parse_number(as.character(.))))\n\nengland_ks4final &lt;- england_ks4final %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(URN))\n\nengland_abs &lt;- england_abs %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN))\n\nengland_census &lt;- england_census %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN))\n\nengland_school_information &lt;- england_school_information %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN))\n\n# Left join england_ks4final with england_abs\nengland_school_2022_23 &lt;- england_ks4final %&gt;%\n  left_join(england_abs, by = \"URN\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(england_census, by = \"URN\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(england_school_information, by = \"URN\")\n\ndata_types &lt;- sapply(england_school_2022_23, class)\nengland_school_2022_23_meta &lt;- data.frame(Field = names(data_types), DataType = data_types)\n\nbtn_sub &lt;- england_school_2022_23 %&gt;%\n  filter(URN %in% btn_urn_list$urn)\n\n#P8_BANDING\nengland_school_2022_23_not_special &lt;- england_school_2022_23 %&gt;%\n  filter(MINORGROUP != \"Special school\" & ADMPOL.x == \"NSE\")\n\neng_sch_2022_23_not_special_plus &lt;- england_school_2022_23_not_special %&gt;% left_join(\n  edubase_schools, by = join_by(URN == urn)\n)\n\n\ncalculate_index_of_dissimilarity &lt;- function(df) {\n  # Ensure the dataframe has the necessary columns\n  required_columns &lt;- c(\"TFSM6CLA1A\", \"TNOTFSM6CLA1A\")\n  if (!all(required_columns %in% colnames(df))) {\n    stop(\"Dataframe must contain the columns: TFSM6CLA1A and TNOTFSM6CLA1A\")\n  }\n  \n  # Calculate the total number of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils\n  total_disadvantaged &lt;- sum(df$TFSM6CLA1A, na.rm = TRUE)\n  total_non_disadvantaged &lt;- sum(df$TNOTFSM6CLA1A, na.rm = TRUE)\n  \n  # Calculate the index of dissimilarity\n  df$dissimilarity_component &lt;- abs(df$TFSM6CLA1A / total_disadvantaged -

Before prescribing a treatment, should we have not carried out a thorough examination of the patient first in case a more serious underlying ailment is causing the symptoms? This is all before we get anywhere near the negative side effects.\nNot wanting to strain the metaphor further, how do we know for sure that a lack of mixing is indeed the main factor holding back disadvantaged attainment? What if it is not? And if it is not, what is more important? And if there are more important factors, might there be more effective routes to minimising disadvantaged educational outcomes that could offer better (more than a max 1pt improvement in 1 subject at GSCE) or faster results, and indeed do so without the levels of disruption currently on the table?\nThese are very important questions to ask, not least because under the current proposals, one of the experimental ‘treatments’ being prescribed by the council is forced mixing in schools through artificially reducing places in schools for local students and busing (or for at least 1/4 of children, privately driving) significant numbers of students from some neighbourhoods (some by ‘choice’ and some through ‘displacement’ - see the PGS explainer here) to schools a long way from their homes. This kind of forced mixing not only has a questionable history but has huge negative social/community, financial and environmental implications for our city (many of which were raised in the Parent Support Group’s latest deputation at the Labour Cabinet meeting in November) which have thus-far been ignored by those advocating for the proposals.\nAnd as I will show below, the treatment currently being prescribed by the council, worse than being ineffective, is likely worsen attainment across the city - again, at risk of stretching the metaphor too far, this could be akin 19th Century doctors prescribing arsenic for psoriasis (Sarfraz 2023) - it sort of works in some ways, but OH GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer is: Yes, yes there is. The longer answer is there are lots of things; from raw income deprivation or requiring SEN support, to simply moving schools (see p8 of (Claymore 2023a) to see the relative effects of some of these) - all can have some impact on attainment. But there is one factor, over an above everything else, that affects attainment more than any other: Absence from School.\n\n\n\n\nNow at this point, you’d be forgiven for shouting “well that’s bloody obvious, I could have told you that!” - which makes it all the more surprising that it has barely surfaced in the narrative during this whole Brighton Secondary School Admissions engagement/consultation process.\nI genuinely don’t know why it hasn’t, but again the rush to consultation and a general lack of due care and attention in gathering relevant evidence throughout, are probably in the blame line-up - of course assuming that the publicly stated aims actually align with a desire to conduct evidence-based policy.\n\n\nI could get all academic and cite a bunch of papers and government reports, at this juncture, which detail the important role that absence/attendance plays in educational outcomes over and above everything else, but we’ve “had enough of experts”, right? . No? Oh OK then. First up a recent report for the Government’s Social Mobility Commission, where (Riordan, Jopling, and Starr 2021a) state:\n\n“Our statistical models indicate that the strongest predictive factor of the progress made by pupil premium [disadvantaged] students is the school’s absence rate”\n\n\n“schools with lower absence rates have smaller progress gaps; pupil premium students progress more at schools with lower absence rates; This correlation is regardless of whether they begin with low, medium or high rates of absence.”\n\n\n“These findings concur with previous research and we share their interpretation too, that this correlation is most likely to be causal. This is because there is an intuitive underlying causal mechanism: students not in school are less likely to learn the school curriculum.”\n\nNext, (Claymore 2023b) (already citied above) in a paper titled: “Being Present: the Power of Attendance and Stability for Stability for Disadvantaged Pupils” states:\n\n“On average, the association between being absent from school and KS4 outcomes is worse for disadvantaged pupils than their more affluent peers”\n\n\n“Supporting secondary schools to reduce absence, improve behaviour and support within-secondary phase transfers are all key areas of policy focus to boost outcomes of disadvantaged pupils and reduce group gaps in progress and attainment.”\n\n\n“over half of the gap in outcomes between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers is associated with the underlying group differences in absence, exclusion and pupil transfer rates. Improving these underlying factors for disadvantaged pupils should therefore substantially boost outcomes for the group”\n\nI could also go on to cite work by the National Governance Association (NGA 2024) on improving School Attendance, or the Department for Education’s extensive resources on why improving school attendance is important(DfE 2023) (DfE 2024), or this excellent paper by (Klein et al. 2024), but I think you are starting to get the picture. It makes sense, right? If you don’t go to school, it’s harder to learn and achieve.\nSo the literature clearly says absence is important but:\n\nIs absence from school important for Brighton and Hove?\nAnd if it is, is it more or less important than concentrations of disadvantage in schools in the city?\n\nFortunately, as has been the case throughout this whole engagement/consultation exercise, data and analysis can shed some light and help us answer these questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are lots of different reasons why students miss school, for example to attend medical appointments, illness, religious observance, study leave etc. these are likely to be counted as valid reasons and ‘authorised’ by schools. Then there are reasons that are ‘unauthorised’ and these might include things like going on holiday, but also apply to students that might have to stay home to care for family members as well as truancy - i.e. intentionally missing school without permission to be absent.\nReasons for truancy or ‘school refusal’ can be complex and vary between different children, and I won’t go into them here (various sources of information elsewhere if you are interested, including here), but one of the ways in which longer-term absence is measured is if more than 10% of the sessions in a school year are missed. This is often referred to as ‘Persistent Absence’ in the data and this is what we will zoom in on here (rather than other types of authorised or unauthorised absence).\n\n\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) publishes various datasets online which cover things like attainment and absence at both the Local Authority level and at the level of individual schools. We will start with this dataset - https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/data-catalogue/data-set/be024b4d-4f91-40e4-8a58-50dc53dcc93f - “Absence by geographic level - autumn and spring terms combined” which allows us to look at absence in secondary schools across all local authorities from 2016 until 2023.\nQuestion: What is the national picture of persistent absence and how does Brighton and Hove compare?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#unauthorised absence\n\n#https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/data-catalogue/data-set/be024b4d-4f91-40e4-8a58-50dc53dcc93f\n\n##school performance\n#https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/\n\n\n#from here -

Brighton and Hove and England Overlaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are couple of things worth pointing out in Figure 1 above:\n\nThe problem of persistent absence has increased massively since 2016/17, with stark change in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic, where the median persistent absence had been declining and has reduced to about 12% by 2020, but shot up to over 25% after COVID and is still at about 24% in the most recent data for 2023/24.\nAt the same time, the variance has increased (meaning the median is less representative of the whole data) - with more Local Authorities having rates of persistent absence well above average, with some having over 1/3 of students missing 10% or more of school.\nFor Brighton and Hove this situation is bad. Persistent absence has been above average since 2016/17 and while it had declined to only just above the national average in 2020/21, since the Pandemic, the rates of persistent absence have been well above the national average, in 2023/24 topping out at 28%, 4% above the national average of 24%.\n\n\n\nCode\nabsence_2023 &lt;- absence_secondary %&gt;%\n  filter(year == \"2023\")\n\n\nmean_value &lt;- mean(absence_2023$enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, na.rm = TRUE)\nsd_value &lt;- sd(absence_2023$enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nabsence_2023 &lt;- absence_2023 %&gt;%\n  mutate(deviation_status = case_when(\n    enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &lt; mean_value - 1.96 * sd_value ~ \"Below 1.96 SD\",\n    enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &gt; mean_value + 1.96 * sd_value ~ \"Above 1.96 SD\",\n    enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &lt; mean_value - 1.65 * sd_value & enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &gt;= mean_value - 1.96 * sd_value ~ \"Below 1.65 SD\",\n    enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &gt; mean_value + 1.65 * sd_value & enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &lt;= mean_value + 1.96 * sd_value ~ \"Above 1.65 SD\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Within 1.65 SD\"\n  ))\n\niqr_values &lt;- quantile(absence_2023$enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, probs = c(0.25, 0.75), na.rm = TRUE)\nlower_bound &lt;- iqr_values[1]\nupper_bound &lt;- iqr_values[2]\n\n\nggplot(absence_2023, aes(x = enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, fill = deviation_status)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.8, position = \"identity\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value, color = \"black\", linetype = \"solid\", size = 1) +\n  #geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value + 1.96 * sd_value, color = \"#E41A1C\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  #geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value - 1.96 * sd_value, color = \"#E41A1C\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  #geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value + 1.65 * sd_value, color = \"#377EB8\", linetype = \"dotted\", size = 1) +\n  #geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value - 1.65 * sd_value, color = \"#377EB8\", linetype = \"dotted\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = lower_bound, color = \"#377EB8\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = upper_bound, color = \"#377EB8\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 28.19426, color = \"#4DAF4A\", linetype = \"solid\", size = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 28.19426, y = 6, label = \"Brighton and Hove\", color = \"#4DAF4A\", angle = 90, vjust = 1.5, hjust = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of Persistent Absentees - 10% or More Sessions \\nMissed (2023/24) for State-funded Secondary Schools\",\n       x = \"Percentage of Persistent Absentees\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       fill = \"Deviation Status\") +  # Change legend title\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Below 1.96 SD\" = \"#FF7F00\", \"Above 1.96 SD\" = \"#FF7F00\", \n                               \"Below 1.65 SD\" = \"#984EA3\", \"Above 1.65 SD\" = \"#984EA3\", \n                               \"Within 1.65 SD\" = \"#A6CEE3\"))  # Use custom colors for SD classifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Persistent Absence in State Secondary Schools, All Local Authorities in England 2023/24. Brighton and Hove, Mean, Interquartile Range and Outliers at 90% and 95% added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at just 2023/24 (Figure 2 above), we can see that Brighton and Hove is not quite an outlier (above the 90% percentile at 1.65 standard deviations from the mean) in terms of persistent absence, but it is well above the national average and outside the interquartile range (where 50% of local authorities would lie) with a rate of 28.2%.\nThis is a slightly wordy statistical way of saying that the persistent absence situation in Brighton and Hove raises interest and is much worse than most other places in the country.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Line plot for sess_unauth_totalreasons_rate for Brighton and Hove over all values of year \nabsence_btn &lt;- absence %&gt;%\n  filter(la_name == \"Brighton and Hove\" & education_phase == \"State-funded secondary\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.factor(substr(time_period, 1, 4)))  # Extract year and convert to factor\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- absence %&gt;%\n  filter(education_phase == \"State-funded secondary\" & is.na(la_name))\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, color = region_name, group = region_name)) +\n  geom_point(data = filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, color = region_name, group = region_name)) +\n  geom_line(data = absence_btn, aes(x = year, y = enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, color = \"Brighton and Hove\"), group = 1, size = 1) +\n  geom_point(data = absence_btn, aes(x = year, y = enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, color = \"Brighton and Hove\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Persistent Absence (10% or more sessions missed) Rates Over Time \\nfor State-funded Secondary Schools by Region\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Persistent Absence Rate\",\n       color = \"Region\") +  # Change legend title\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\", brewer.pal(9, \"Set1\")))  # Add black for Brighton and Hove and Set1 for regions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Persistent Absence Over Time, Compared to Regions in England\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we compare Brighton and Hove with other areas in the county (Figure 3) - here I have chosen regions simply because there are fewer of them and they can fit on a single graph relatively tidily - we can see that Persistent Absence is worse in the Local Authority than it is in any other region in the country.\n\n\n\n\nAll data below are downloaded from - https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/\nSo what does persistent absence look like at the school-level in Brighton? Are all schools contributing to the city performing so badly on persistent absence or are there areas where absence is particularly bad?

Cardinal Newman, Patcham, Dorothy Stringer and Blatchington Mill are all very close to the national average.\nKing’s School and Varndean have better/lower persistent absence rates than average - King’s much lower.\nAt the other end of the scale, PACA and Hove Park have noticably above-average/worse persistent absence rates, while Longhill has 42.4% of students persistently absent with BACA an outlier with an incredibly high rate of 51.8% making it a school suffering from one of the the highest rates of persistent absence in the country.\nThe high, above average, city-levels of persistent absence over time shown at the local authority level, appear to be being driven mainly by students who attend two schools - Longhill and BACA\n\n\n\n\n\nData from here - https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-4-performance/2022-23\nWhile we are here, it will be useful to look at the disadvantaged pupil picture in the same way. This is because later on we will compare the effects that both disadvantage and absence have on attainment to see which is more important both nationally and in the city. Figure 5 below plots a similar histogram to that above, but this time for disadvantaged pupils.\nTaking the description from the DfE “Pupils are defined as disadvantaged if they are known to have been eligible for free school meals at any point in the past six years (from year 6 to year 11), if they are recorded as having been looked after for at least one day or if they are recorded as having been adopted from care.”\n\n\nCode\n#https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-4-performance/2022-23\n\n## \"Pupils are defined as disadvantaged if they are known to have been eligible for free school meals at any point in the past six years (from year 6 to year 11), if they are recorded as having been looked after for at least one day or if they are recorded as having been adopted from care.\"\n\n##FSM - % disadvantaged at the end of KS4 (6-year measure)\n# ggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(x = PTFSM6CLA1A\n# \n# )) +\n#   geom_histogram(fill = \"#b3cde3\", color = \"black\") +  # Pastel color for the bars\n#   labs(title = \"% disadvantaged at the end of KS4\",\n#        x = \"% disadvantaged at the end of KS4\",\n#        y = \"Count\") +\n#   theme_minimal()\nmedian_value &lt;- median(england_school_2022_23_not_special$PTFSM6CLA1A, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\nbtn_sub &lt;- btn_sub %&gt;%\n  mutate(SCHNAME.x = factor(SCHNAME.x, levels = SCHNAME.x[order(PTFSM6CLA1A, decreasing = F)]))\n\n#btn_sub[,c(\"SCHNAME.x\",\"PTFSM6CLA1A\")]\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(x = PTFSM6CLA1A)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"grey\", alpha = 0.4) +  # New color for the bars with added transparency\n  geom_vline(xintercept = median_value, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dotted\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"% Pupils Disadvantaged at end of KS4 - 2022/23 Academic Year - \\n(All Secondary Schools England, Brighton overlaid)\",\n       x = \"% Pupils Disadvantaged\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       color = \"School (ordered lowest % disadvantaged)\") +  # Change legend title to \"School\"\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_vline(data = btn_sub, aes(xintercept = PTFSM6CLA1A, color = SCHNAME.x), linetype = \"solid\", linewidth = 1) +  # Solid vertical lines colored by SCHNAME.x\n  scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(10, \"Set3\")) +  # Use Set3 palette for high contrast with 10 colors\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", size = 0.2, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\")) + guides(col = guide_legend(nrow = 4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Percentage of Pupils Disadvantaged at the end of KS4, England (Brighton and Hove Schools overlaid).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national median for disadvantaged pupils at the end of KS4 is around 24%. Most schools in Brighton have below the national average rates of disadvantage.\nPACA (26%) and Longhill (29%) have slightly above the national average rate of disadvantage, but not significantly so.\nBACA, on the other hand, has a very high rate of disadvantage, with 45% of pupils being disadvantaged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring attainment is tricky. Absolute attainment (number of A*s at GCSE - sorry, I know we don’t have A*s anymore, showing my age, but you know what I mean) is a crude measure as it fails to take any account of the diversity of schools and their cohorts, so for a number of years now the preferred measure of attainment has been to look at the ‘value added’ by schools to their pupils by essentially comparing the levels of attainment of pupils when they leave secondary school after their GCSEs, with the levels of attainment they came in with after Primary School.\nThe standard measure of ‘value added’ used by the government for the last few years is something called the “Progress 8” score. “The score is calculated for each student by comparing their GCSE (or equivalent) results with the results of peers who achieved a similar level of attainment at the end of primary school” (Riordan, Jopling, and Starr 2021b). This is done across 8 subjects/qualifications (hence the name), with England and Maths given a double weighting. It is a ratio centred on Zero and generally ranges between -1 and +1 for most schools (when aggregated to school level).\nProgress 8 has been criticised as a measure for various reasons, including its perceived volatility, however the general conclusions in the literature are, it’s not perfect, but it’s certainly better than the old measure of counting students achieving 5 A*-C grades - various pieces including by (Prior et al., n.d.) and (Beynon 2024) here, and here if you want to follow up. And in an Institute for Fiscal Studies report, (Britton, Clark, and Lee 2023) evaluate the effectiveness of using Progress 8 and also conclude that\n“controlling for prior attainment alone is sufficient to produce accurate estimates, and we find no compelling evidence to suggest that the government’s current effectiveness measure, Progress 8, is unreliable. Given its relative simplicity, Progress 8 is a usable measure for teachers and schools, leading us to conclude that there is a limited case for reform based on our data.”\nSo most of what follows will relate to Progress 8. However, since the first pass at this I’ve been into the council and seen Jacob Taylor, Richard Barker and others. Jacob was concerned that Progress 8 incorporates disadvantage into the measure - it doesn’t quite as it simply measures progress between KS2 and KS4 for pupils relative to the national picture and as we’ll see below, while there is some correlation between P8 and disadvantage, it’s weak. It simply acknowledges that some students start KS3 at higher and lower points. However, to assuage those fears, I’ll also look briefly at Attainment 8 - which is the measure of raw attainment, not accounting for prior attainment.\n\n\nCode\n# ggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(x = P8MEA)) +\n#   geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = \"#b3cde3\", color = \"black\") +  # Pastel color for the bars\n#   labs(title = \"Distribution of P8MEA\",\n#        x = \"P8MEA\",\n#        y = \"Count\") +\n#   theme_minimal()\n\nmedian_value &lt;- median(england_school_2022_23_not_special$P8MEA, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\nbtn_sub &lt;- btn_sub %&gt;%\n  mutate(SCHNAME.x = factor(SCHNAME.x, levels = SCHNAME.x[order(P8MEA, decreasing = T)]))\n\n#btn_sub[,c(\"SCHNAME.x\",\"P8MEA\")]\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(x = P8MEA)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = \"grey\", alpha = 0.4) +  # New color for the bars with added transparency\n  geom_vline(xintercept = median_value, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dotted\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 Measure Across the Full 2022/23 Academic Year - \\n(All Secondary Schools England, Brighton overlaid)\",\n       x = \"Progress 8 Measure\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       color = \"School (ordered highest Progress8)\") +  # Change legend title to \"School\"\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_vline(data = btn_sub, aes(xintercept = P8MEA, color = SCHNAME.x), linetype = \"solid\", linewidth = 1) +  # Solid vertical lines colored by SCHNAME.x\n  scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(10, \"Set3\")) +  # Use Set3 palette for high contrast with 10 colors\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", size = 0.2, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\")) + guides(col = guide_legend(nrow = 4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Progress 8 across all schools in England, 2022/23 with Brighton and Hove schools overlaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations - Figure 6\n\nNote, these are not the latest Progress 8 scores from 2023/24 - these have just been publilshed, but not with useful comparative data for the same year yet, so I’m sticking to 2022/23 for now. However, if you want to look at the latest Progress 8 Scores for Brighton Schools, you can see them here. Of note in 2023/24, however, is the fact that of the schools performing below average, BACA has made a notable improvement from -0.5 to -0.4 in the latest P8 stats. Longhill has declined further from -0.62 to -0.7 and Patcham has declined from -0.21 to -0.45. At the other end of the scale, of those above average, Blatchington Mill has improved from 0.03 to 0.3.\nAs Progress 8 scores are relative to a national average, the distribution around the mean of 0 is about as normal as you might get and the distribution of Brighton schools around this mean is also pretty normal with as many schools above as below average.\nLonghill has the worst Progress 8 scores in the City in 2022/23, with BACA performing slightly better at that time, although with BACA improving and Longhill declining in 2024, the gap between these schools has increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Attainment 8 across all schools in England, 2022/23 with Brighton and Hove schools overlaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations - Figure 7\n\nAttainment 8 is simply raw attainment scores at the end of KS4, not accounting for prior achievement.\nThe histogram is a slightly odd shape with long-tails (i.e. a large number of small counts of schools stretching out to the extremes of the plot). This means when we compare with other data which are more normally distributed, some non-linear patterns might emerge.\nAs far as Brighton and Hove are concerned, however, the majority of schools in the city achieve above the national median for Attainment 8 - which brings us back to my observations in past pieces that in raw attainment terms, Brighton is an above-average city. Only Longhill and BACA are achieving below average.\n\n\n\n\nIn a deputation to Labour Cabinet on 6th December 2024, representatives from Class Divide aimed an arrow at ‘apparently sophisticated analysis’ from groups in the city opposed to elements of the council’s proposals.\nWhat I hope to offer below is not particularly sophisticated as hopefully you will be able to see with your own eyes the patterns that the data on Absence, Disadvantage and Attainment reveals and arrive at the same interpretations I have.\nBeing unsophisticated does not mean that I will assume an understanding of some of the more esoteric mathematical dimensions of this analysis, but I will try to keep it as simple as I can and please email me at the address at the top of this piece if you have any questions or queries.\n\n\nTo begin with, I will start with a simple scatter plot. We probably all drew these by hand in science at some point in school. You may have even had a go at drawing a line of best-fit through the points with a ruler (I remember my teachers getting us to do this). The idea is the line is our best attempt at summarising the pattern shown by the dots in the scatter plot, and can be thought of as the average of all the points.\nThe plot below in Figure 8 is a scatter plot, with each point representing a school in England. The y-axis (vertical) has the average Progress 8 score at the end of KS4 for that school in 2022/23. In this plot, the x-axis (horizontal) represents the % of enrolments at that school that are persistently absent (over 10% of sessions missed) in the same year.\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\n\nlm_model &lt;- lm(P8MEA ~ PPERSABS10, data = england_school_2022_23_not_special)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1, 1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[2, 1], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +  \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence %, All Schools, England, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Enrollments who are persistently absent\",\n       y = \"Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 100, y = Inf, label = paste(\"Intercept:\", intercept, \"\\nSlope:\", slope, \"\\nR²:\", r_squared), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 2, size = 5, color = \"black\") +\n  xlim(0, 100)\n\n\n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_persabs.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the plot and all points together, it should hopefully be clear that on the whole, as the % of enrolments who are persistently absent increases, the value of the Progress 8 score decreases. The more a school has high levels of persistent absence, the lower its Progress 8 score is likely to be. There are, of course, a few weird values (outliers) which don’t follow this trend, but most do.\nThe blue line through the centre of the plot is the line of best-fit (also known as the ‘regression’ line). This is drawn by the computer by minimising the total sum of the squared vertical distances (known as residuals) between each black dot in the plot and the blue line itself. In doing this it ends up with the sum of the positive (dots above the line) and negative residuals (dots below the line) equalling zero.\nThe blue line has two properties that are useful for helping us describe the cloud of points it is representing:\n\nThe first is known as the ‘intercept’. This is the value on the y-axis of the blue line as it crosses zero. In our example, it can be thought of as the value of Progress 8 we would expect for a school if it had 0% persistent absence. Our average best-case Progress 8, if you like. In our case, this value would be 1.06.\nThe second is known as the ‘slope’. This is the change in the value of \\(y\\) (Progress 8) for a one-unit change (1% persistent absence) on the \\(x\\)-axis. In our example, the slope is -0.04. This means that for every additional 1% of students that are persistently absent, on average, the Progress 8 score for that school will reduce by -0.04.\nThe other way of thinking about the slope is how much effect \\(x\\) (persistent absence) is having on \\(y\\) (Progress 8) - if there is there is a causal relationship (which I will return to below). The higher the value of the slope, the more effect \\(x\\) is having on \\(y\\), the lower the value, the less effect it is having. It’s worth also noting that the slope value is in units of \\(x\\).\n\nOn the plot above, I have calculated one more useful property of the points which statisticians know as the \\(R^2\\). In lay terms, this is a number between 0-1 that describes how good a representation of the points the blue line is. The closer the points hug the line, the closer to 1 the value gets. If all of the black points fell exactly on the line, the \\(R^2\\) = 1. Another way of describing the blue line is it’s a model (a representation) of the black points. The closer to 1 our \\(R^2\\) value is, the better our model is and the more reliable it is at describing the underlying relationship.\nOur blue line (model) has an \\(R^2\\) = 0.47. Another way of thinking about this is to say that 47% of the variation in Progress 8 scores between schools can be explained just by the variation in persistent absence. So almost 50%. In statistical terms, this is a very good model. The relationship between Progress 8 and persistent absence is very strong.\nOne note of caution with interpreting relationships like this is often it is easy to confuse correlation (things going up or down together) with causation (\\(x\\) causing \\(y\\), rather than \\(y\\) causing \\(x\\)). This is something all researchers need to be aware of and careful to identify clear theoretical reasons behind suggested relationships. However, in this particular case, the causal pathways are clear. As (Riordan, Jopling, and Starr 2021c) (cited earlier) states: “this correlation [between absence and attainment] is most likely to be causal. This is because there is an intuitive underlying causal mechanism: students not in school are less likely to learn the school curriculum.”\nBrighton Schools have been overlaid - I will return to this in more detail later, but it is worth commenting that most are above the regression line. Positive residuals. This means relative the the levels of persistent absence they are experiencing, they are, on the whole, doing better than most other schools in similar situations, nationally.\nSo this simple plot actually contains a lot of information:\n\nWe know that Persistent Absence explains almost 50% of the variance in Progress 8 scores at the school level in England in 2022/23.\nWe know that, on average, reducing persistent absence in a school by 1% will likely increase their Progress 8 score by 0.04. 10% reduction in persistent absence will lead to a Progress 8 increasing by 0.4.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(mgcv)\n\n# fit a generalised additive model\n\n# lm_model &lt;- gam(ATT8SCR ~ PPERSABS10, data = england_school_2022_23_not_special)\n# lm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\n# lm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$p.coeff\n# intercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1], 2)\n# slope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[2], 2)\n# r_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.sq, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = ATT8SCR, x = PPERSABS10)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", se = TRUE) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, colour = \"red\") + geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = ATT8SCR, x = PPERSABS10, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence %, all schools in England, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Enrollments who are persistently absent\",\n       y = \"Attainment 8 measure\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  xlim(0, 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlm_model &lt;- lm(log(ATT8SCR) ~ log(PPERSABS10), data = england_school_2022_23_not_special)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1, 1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[2, 1], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", se = TRUE) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ exp(-0.05*x), se = TRUE, colour = \"red\") + geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence %, all schools in England, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"log(% Enrollments who are persistently absent)\",\n       y = \"log(Attainment 8 measure)\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2.5, y = 4, label = paste(\"Intercept:\", intercept, \"\\nSlope:\", slope, \"\\nR²:\", r_squared), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 2, size = 5, color = \"black\") + \n  ylim(2,5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Log-Log plot Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to note about the Attainment 8 data and its relationship to Persistent Absence is, in its raw form, it is not a linear relationship, but rather an inverse power-law relationship. This can be seen with the model curve estimate overlaid in red.\nWhat this means in practice is that in raw-attainment terms, once a school gets below about 25% persistent absence, for every 1% point reduction in absence, the corresponding improvement in Attainment 8 gets magnified.\nAt the other end of the distribution, once a school gets above about 35% persistent absence, further increases in persistent absence won’t reduce average Attainment 8 much further - which makes sense as at some point, even just turning up and completing an exam will lead to a minimum grade. Very rarely will Attainment 8 dip below 25.\nTaking the log of both Attainment 8 and Persistent absence allows us to view this inverse power law relationship as a more conventional straight-line. We can see this in Figure 10 which is known as a log-log plot.\nBrighton Schools have been overlaid - and as with Progress 8, it is a similar story with Attainment 8: most are above the regression line. Positive residuals again. To re-iterate, this means relative to the levels of persistent absence they are experiencing, Brighton schools are, on the whole, doing better than most other schools in similar situations, nationally.\n\n\n\n\nOK, now we’re warmed up, here’s a very similar scatter plot, but this time plotting the % of disadvantaged students at a school relative to Progress 8. You might notice some similarities and some differences and I will highlight the ones I think relevant below.\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\n\nlm_model &lt;- lm(P8MEA ~ PTFSM6CLA1A, data = england_school_2022_23_not_special)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1, 1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[2, 1], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PTFSM6CLA1A)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) + \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PTFSM6CLA1A, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 vs % Percentage of Disadvantaged Students, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Percentage of Disadvantaged Students\",\n       y = \"Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 100, y = Inf, label = paste(\"Intercept:\", intercept, \"\\nSlope:\", slope, \"\\nR²:\", r_squared), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 2, size = 5, color = \"black\") +\n  xlim(0, 100)\n\n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_persabs.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Progress 8 vs % Disadvantaged across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to note is there is also a negative correlation in this graph. As the proportion of disadvantaged students a school has goes up, on average, the progress 8 score goes down.\nHowever, hopefully you will have noticed a few differences between this plot and the first one.\n\nSlope - the slope of the blue line is shallower. This means that (assuming a causal relationship), on average, having a higher concentration of disadvantaged students in a school has a less severe negative impact on Progress 8. A 1% increase in disadvantaged students will only lead to a 0.01 decrease in Progress 8 (compared to a 0.04 decrease for persistent absence).\nIntercept - the intercept is 0.36, which means that, on average, if a school had 0% disadvantaged students, it might expect a Progress 8 score of 0.36. This is compared to an intercept of 1.06 for Persistent absence, again, suggesting reducing absence rather than disadvantage concentrations is likely to have a greater impact on Progress 8.\n\\(R^2\\) - this is 0.15. So the % of disadvantaged students in a school can only predict 15% of the variation in Progress 8 scores (compared to 47% for Persistent Absence). It is also possible to see this visually - the cloud of points in this plot are far more dispersed than in the earlier plot, showing visually the weaker relationship.\n\nWe will look at this in more detail later, but for Brighton the relationship between progress 8 and disadvantage is broadly negative, but it is clear that it is not a straightforward linear relationship at all.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\n\nlm_model &lt;- lm(ATT8SCR ~ exp(-0.05*PTFSM6CLA1A), data = england_school_2022_23_not_special, , na.action = na.omit)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1,1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1,2], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = ATT8SCR, x = PTFSM6CLA1A)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = ATT8SCR, x = PTFSM6CLA1A, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", se = TRUE) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ exp(-0.05*x), se = T, colour = \"red\") +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ exp(-0.09*x), se = T, colour = \"red\") +   #geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula=(y ~ x), se = TRUE, colour = \"green\") + \n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs % Percentage of Disadvantaged Students, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Percentage of Disadvantaged Students\",\n       y = \"Attainment 8 measure\",\n       color = \"Ofsted Rating\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  xlim(0, 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Attainment 8 vs % Disadvantaged across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Remove rows with NA or infinite values after taking log\ncleaned_data &lt;- england_school_2022_23_not_special %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(ATT8SCR) & ATT8SCR &gt; 0 & !is.na(PTFSM6CLA1A) & PTFSM6CLA1A &gt; 0)\n\n# Fit the model again\nlm_model &lt;- lm(log(ATT8SCR) ~ log(PTFSM6CLA1A), data = cleaned_data, na.action = na.exclude)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1,1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1,2], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", se = TRUE) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = T, colour = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A), colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ exp(-0.09*x), se = T, colour = \"red\") +   #geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula=(y ~ x), se = TRUE, colour = \"green\") + \n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs % Percentage of Disadvantaged Students, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"log(% Percentage of Disadvantaged Students)\",\n       y = \"log(Attainment 8 measure)\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = Inf, y = 3, label = paste(\"Intercept:\", intercept, \"\\nSlope:\", slope, \"\\nR²:\", r_squared), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 2, size = 5, color = \"black\") + ylim(1, 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Log-Log Attainment 8 vs % Disadvantaged across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as raw attainment is concerned, we have a similar log-linear relationship between Attainment 8 and disadvantage as we did with Progress 8 and disadvantage. It is also notable again that disadvantage has both a shallower slope (less influential as a predictor of raw attainment) than absence and a weaker correlation with an \\(R^2\\) of 0.27 (compared to 0.56 for Progress 8).\nRelative to all other schools in the country with similar levels of disadvantage, the good schools on the whole perform better than average (positive residuals above the line) and the requires improvement schools worse than we would expect, given their levels of disadvantage).\n\n\n\n\nAt a national level in 2022/23, then, it’s clear that persistent absence is both a better predictor of Progress 8 and Attainment 8 than disadvantage and stands a better chance of being more influential on progress outcomes if reduced in schools. If I were a policy maker and sitting on top of evidence such as this and I wanted to improve educational outcomes using some high-level lever, the most sensible course of action would be to look at persistent absence before getting anywhere near disadvantage.\nIt also points to the premise in the consultation documents I mentioned earlier - that outcomes in the city are being driven by economic advantage - potentially being incorrect. This evidence seems to suggest that while economic advantage/disadvantage might play a part, factors like persistent absence are likely to be playing even more of a part.\nIt’s also the case that once we control for levels of disadvantage and absence and compare schools in Brighton with other schools in England in a similar position, most schools in Brighton are actually performing better than expected most of the time, both on Attainment 8 and Progress 8.\nAs such, some questions you might well be asking at this point are:\n\n“why have we heard nothing about persistent absence from the council or organisations like Class Divide over the last few months?“\n\nand\n\n“why has the council been zooming in on trying to mix students up in the city when a much more important factor and potentially bigger policy win is sitting there being ignored?”\n\nI genuinely don’t know the answers - perhaps they can provide them in due course. But in the meantime let’s dig a little deeper into the data to see if even more questions or observations emerge.\n\n\n\n\nThe plots above are informative, but we can actually make them work a little harder and reveal even more dimensions to the issue.\nFigure 14 below is exactly the same plot as in Figure 8, but this time I have coloured the schools according to their last Ofsted rating and have highlighted each school in Brighton for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data &lt;- eng_sch_2022_23_not_special_plus %&gt;%\n  filter(OFSTEDRATING != \"Inadequate\" & !is.na(OFSTEDRATING))\nfiltered_region &lt;- eng_sch_2022_23_not_special_plus %&gt;%\n  filter(OFSTEDRATING != \"Inadequate\" & !is.na(OFSTEDRATING) & !is.na(gor_name))\nbtn_sub &lt;- filtered_region %&gt;%\n  filter(URN %in% btn_urn_list$urn)\n\n\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +  # Add linear model line for england_school_2022_23\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Enrollments who are persistently absent\",\n       y = \"Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\",\n       color = \"Ofsted Rating\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Add another layer with btn_sub points and labels with sticks\nplot + \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-1.5, 1.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\") \n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_persabs.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence, by OfSted Rating, All Schools in England, 2022/23.

Which makes intuitive sense - all other things being equal, if no schools had any persistent absence, even though it predicts almost 50% of the variation in P8, the other qualities of Outstanding schools are likely to make their P8 scores better.\nThe slopes also become less steep as you get towards Outstanding. This means that for outstanding schools, even though persistent absence still affects their P8 scores negatively, the effect is less severe than for good, requires improvement or special measures schools, where the effect is sucessively more amplifed.\n\nFor Brighton (see Figure 16 below for a zoomed in view - or here for an interactive version), most of the schools in the city are rated good in 2022/23 (except for Longhill and BACA which are ‘requires improvement’).\n\nThe relationship between persistent absence and attainment, on average, appears no different in Brighton than it does in the rest of the country. It’s slope and intercept are similar to the ‘good schools’ slope for the rest of the country.\nWe already know that BACA and Longhill have serious problems with students who are persistently absent from those schools and it would appear that reducing persistent absence at these schools to anything even near to the city average, would have a big impact on attainment.\nIt’s worth nothing that this is 2022/23 data and in 2023/24, the P8 situation for BACA and Blatchington mill gets better, but worse for Longhill and Patcham.\n\nIn some ways, despite BACA having such dire persistent absence, for a school with that many students not attending on a regular basis, it falls above the city regression line. This means in some senses, it is actually doing better for its students, attainment wise, than we would expect.\nThe opposite is true for Longhill and Patcham - relative to their persistent absence rates, these schools are doing worse than we would expect - they are below the black regression line. Both would still certainly improve if they cut their persistent absence rates, but it is clear that there are other things also going on. More so than in other schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\ngeom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10), method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-1.5, 1.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\") +  # Add linear model line for england_school_2022_23\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Enrollments who are persistently absent\",\n       y = \"Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence, by OfSted Rating, Brighton and Hove Schools Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data &lt;- eng_sch_2022_23_not_special_plus %&gt;%\n  filter(OFSTEDRATING != \"Inadequate\" & !is.na(OFSTEDRATING))\nfiltered_region &lt;- eng_sch_2022_23_not_special_plus %&gt;%\n  filter(OFSTEDRATING != \"Inadequate\" & !is.na(OFSTEDRATING) & !is.na(gor_name))\nbtn_sub &lt;- filtered_region %&gt;%\n  filter(URN %in% btn_urn_list$urn)\n\n\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"log(% Enrollments who are persistently absent)\",\n       y = \"log(Attainment 8 measure)\",\n       color = \"Ofsted Rating\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Add another layer with btn_sub points and labels with sticks\nplot + \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10)), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10)), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-0.5, 0.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\") + \n  ylim(2,5) + xlim(1,6)\n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_persabs.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence, by OfSted Rating, All Schools in England, 2022/23.

Below in Figure 20 and Figure 21 the data are grouped according to region. I have done this as we already know from work in previous weeks, that London is an outlier educationally (generally achieving better attainment scores than the rest of the country and doing better by its most disadvantaged pupils).\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_region, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, colour = gor_name)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +  # Add linear model line for england_school_2022_23\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Enrollments who are persistently absent\",\n       y = \"Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\",\n       color = \"Region\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Add another layer with btn_sub points and labels with sticks\nplot + \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-1.5, 1.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\") \n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_persabs.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence, by Region, All Schools in England, 2022/23.

Part of this is a function of the small number of schools in the city meaning drawing a reliable regression (bet-fit) line is hard because small changes to just one or two schools can have a big impact on the line.\n\nOne possible interpretation of the shallower line could be that it suggests that reducing persistent absence in the city might have slightly less of an impact on Progress 8 scores than it does in other regions. However, I don’t think this is the correct interpretation.\nHaving a look a what schools are impacting the line - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/oost57whub - it’s possible to observe that the shallowness of the line relative to English regions is a function of the small number of points and BACA performing better than would be expected given the very high number of persistent absentees in the school. Dropping BACA’s Progress 8 from -0.5 to something like -0.65 would bring the line down to something like the regional slopes.\nConversely, BACA’s 2023/24 improvement (although we don’t know the corresponding persistent absence) is likely to make the slope even shallower. So this is not that improving persistent absence in the city would have less impact than it would elsewhere in the country, rather BACA despite a headline ‘below average’ Progress 8 score, is actually doing much better than we would expect given the levels of persistent absence and this is pulling the slope upwards for the city.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_region, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), colour = gor_name)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +  # Add linear model line for filtered_region\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"log(% Enrollments who are persistently absent)\",\n       y = \"log(Attainment 8 measure)\",\n       color = \"Region\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n# Add another layer with btn_sub points and labels with sticks\nplot +\n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10)), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10)), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-1.5, 1.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Log-Log Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence, by Region, All Schools in England, 2022/23.

This means that for outstanding schools, having a higher percentage of disadvantaged students makes very little difference to Progress 8 scores. We can contrast that with the similar line in Figure 14 where persistent absence still had a negative impact even for outstanding schools.\n\nWhat this tells us is it’s possible for outstanding schools to mitigate the impact of disadvantage, but if the students aren’t in the school to begin with, no amount of outstanding teaching will remedy that.\n\nThe slope for Brighton is steeper than the slopes for schools grouped by all levels of Ofsted rating. However, zooming in on the plot (Figure 25 - or interactively here) and examining the slope and the points that are influencing it, it is clear that:\n\nthe distribution of the points means the line is not a very reliable summary (it’s a poor model for Brighton and likely statistically insignificant after controlling for levels of absence - we will come to this later.)\nbut looking at Kings, Stringer and Varndean, rather than schools with more disadvantaged students doing worse than expected, it is back to the point I made on advantaged and disadvantaged attainment in the city here - that Brighton and Hove is doing particularly well for its non-disadvantaged students and these schools are helping pull the line up at the top.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#colour = \"#b3cde3\"\n\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A), colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +  # Add linear model line for england_school_2022_23\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Disadvantaged Student %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Percentage of Disadvantaged Students\",\n       y = \"Attainment 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Add another layer with btn_sub points and labels with sticks\nplot + \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A)), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A)), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A), label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-0.5, 0.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\") + \n  ylim(1,5)\n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_disadvantage.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26: Attainment 8 vs % Disadvantaged, by OfSted Rating, All Schools in England, 2022/23.

The relationship between Attainment 8 and absence is far stronger than it is for disadvantage.\nIn Brighton, it appears that the effect of the relationship between disadvantage and attainment is steeper than for the country average, however, this is an artefact of a number of schools pulling overall attainment up at the top, rather than others pulling it down at the bottom.\nThat said, Longhill consistently performs worse than would be expected on both Progress 8 and Attainment 8, relative to other schools with similar levels of disadvantage. Hove Park has similar levels of deprivation, but crucially, much lower rates of persistent absence and the contrast between the outcomes of the two schools is stark.\nThe point above is a crucial narrative point. We have been told throughout this whole process that it is all about disadvantage, when actually, the evidence is very strongly suggesting that it’s all about absence.\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that the scatters plot in Figure 11 / Figure 23 and Figure 13 / Figure 26 suggest there is a weak relationship between disadvantage and attainment in Brighton should be ringing big alarm bells for Brighton and Hove Council at this point. The consultation is built upon the premise that poor attainment in the city is driven by disadvantage, when the evidence presented here is suggesting at best there a weak association and one which is dwarfed by the persistent absence problem.\nBut one thing we haven’t done yet is look at how much more important persistent absence is than disadvantage and how these compare each other directly and with other factors like Ofsted rating or just being in London. We can also see below in Figure 29 that there is a small amount of positive correlation between absence and disadvantage, so does this matter as well?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29: % Persistent Absent vs % Disadvantaged, All Schools in England, 2022/23.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far we have explored some of the factors that might affect Progress/Attainment 8 Scores in schools across England through visualisation. This is an incredibly useful starting point - and something I would encourage all of my students to do at the beginning of any piece of similar analysis. But while scatter plots are fantastic at allowing us to explore data with two dimensions (\\(x\\) and \\(y\\)) and while it is possible to explore things in three dimensions (see Figure 30 below), we can’t go beyond 3-dimensions visually and the analysis starts to become awkward.\nFortunately, we have done the ground-work above to allow us to begin to make use of some of the statistics which described our plots, to try to understand how multiple variables can affect attainment and compare them with each other to build a more complete understanding of the relative importance of each of the factors we have already explored in this piece.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nfig &lt;- plot_ly(filtered_data, x = ~PTFSM6CLA1A, y = ~P8MEA, z = ~PERCTOT, color = ~OFSTEDRATING)\nfig &lt;- fig %&gt;% add_markers()\nfig &lt;- fig %&gt;% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = '% Disadvantaged'),\n                     yaxis = list(title = 'Progress 8'),\n                     zaxis = list(title = '% Persistent Absence')))\n\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 30: Progress 8 vs % Persistent Absent vs % Disadvantaged, All Schools in England, 2022/23.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can combine all of the variables we have explored above and look at their combined effects on Progress 8 using a simple multiple linear regression model - the workhorse of all statistical models.\nI’m not going to go into details about regression modelling here - suffice to say, if you are interested, there is a lot of material out there. All of my code for these outputs are in this document. All it is worth saying at this point is, if you were able to understand the ideas around the scatter plots and the lines of best fit from earlier and had a reasonable understanding of things like the slope, the intercept and the \\(R^2\\) , then you have pretty much got everything you need to understand what will come out of a regression model.\nThis is something I was asked about in the recent council meeting - A KEY thing to note about multiple regression models is because they allow you to look at several variables at the same time, where one variable is more important than the others, it will emerge in the analysis. And indeed, where they might overlap a bit (such as with absence and disadvantage) the one that is more important will shine more brightly.\nIn the models I will present below, the variables are the names in the original data file, so to be clear, these are:\n\nP8MEA - School Level Progress 8 Score in 2022/23 at the end of KS4, adjusted for extreme values\nPPERSABS10 - Percent of Pupils who are Persistently Absent (missing over 10% of sessions)\nPTFSM6CLA1A - Percentage of Pupils who are classified as ‘disadvantaged’ - having received Free School Meals at any point in the preceding 6 years.\nOFSTEDRATING - Ofsted rating at the last inspection\ngor_name - name of the Government Office Region the School resides within\n\nIn the regression model, just as in the scatter plots, Progress 8 is the variable on the \\(y\\)-axis. In regression parlance, it is also known as the ‘dependent variable’. In the model, we are trying to see what the combined effect the other variables (\\(x\\)-variables, or independent variables) have on explaining variation in Progress 8.\nWhen we run the model using a piece of standard statistical software (I’m using R here) we get a series of outputs which tell us how well we can explain \\(y\\) (Progress 8). The main outputs are the same as we saw earlier - an intercept value, some estimates of the slope parameters and an \\(R^2\\) for the whole model.\nWe also get some other useful pieces of information -\n\na ‘standard error’ number - this is essentially a numeric representation of how close or far the black dots not on the blue line in Figure 8 and Figure 11 are away from that line. Big standard errors relative to the slope value show that that value is probably not reliable.\na t-statistic. This is useful as it is the slope value divided by the standard error and has the properly of then effectively being standardised and so comparable with other t-values in the model. I often use them as a short-hand for indicating which variables in the model are most important.\na p-value. The p-value is calcuated from the t-statistic and is a shorthand for determining whether a variable is ‘statistically significant’ in the model. I won’t go into the detail now, but the rule-of-thumb frequently used in statistics is if the p-value is less than 0.05, then this says that there is a greater than 0.95 (95%) probability that the slope value / estimate is reliable and a true relationship between the x variable in question and the y variable we are trying to predict. 95% confidence is the usual stamp of approval in a statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n## regression model\n\nlibrary(gglm)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(jtools)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# Create a linear model\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(P8MEA ~ PPERSABS10 + PTFSM6CLA1A + OFSTEDRATING, data = filtered_region)\n\n#summary(model)\n\n#vif_values &lt;- car::vif(model)\n#vif_values\n\nsumm(model, scale = F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n2517 (42 missing obs. deleted)\n\n\nDependent variable\nP8MEA\n\n\nType\nOLS linear regression\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nF(6,2510)\n508.03\n\n\nR²\n0.55\n\n\nAdj.

This is a good model with strong predictive power.\nStandardised t-values indicate which variables are having the most influence on explaining that variation in Progress 8.\n\nPersistent Absence - PPRESABS10 - is the most important variable in the model with a negative t-value of -28.11 (Progress 8 goes down as absence goes up). The next most important is Ofsted-Outstanding with a positive t-value of 18.69 (being in an outstanding school pushes Progress 8 up). The next most important is Ofsted - requires improvement, which has a negative t-value of -11.55.\nThe overall % of disadvantaged students has a negative effect as we would expect, but it is a comparatively small effect compared to these other variables, with a t-value of only -5.48.\n\nThe standardised plot below the tabular output give a visual representation of this overall pattern. Here the coefficients have been scaled so they are not the t-values, but the broad patterns are the same and are perhaps more intuitive to interpret.\nThis model provides a robust statistical corroboration of the patterns we were inferring from the scatterplots earlier in this analysis. Absence, not disadvantage is the most important factor in determining outcomes. This, of course, is exactly what the wider literature was already telling us, but crucially, not the message that was coming out of Brighton and Hove council when we have been told over and again - not based on any evidence - that disadvantage is what needs to be focused on to improve attainment.\nWe can take this model further and add additional variables in to see if we can explain any more of the variation.

We can, of course, keep building this model and adding additional variables in. For now, as we have explained most of the variance in the model, we will not keep going. In future weeks, I may go further, however.\nWhere we have p-values of &gt;0.05, these variables are statistically insignificant, so we can ignore their parameters - they are not influencing the model. This is the case for a lot of the regions, however, London sticks out as it is both statistically significant and positive on its effect on attainment. This aligns with observations we have made in previous weeks about the importance of London in England’s education story.\nMost of the other variables don’t change much with the addition of regions, however the importance of absence decreases slightly (London having low rates of absence, in accounting for it separately in the model, it makes sense that some of that effect from London disappears). Similarly, the affect of disadvantage increases slightly - again, an impact of including London which has very high levels of disadvantage, but also high levels of attainment in that disadvantage, so including London increases the effect elsewhere.\nHowever, even with London in the model, Absence is still the most important factor by far, followed by being an Ofsted outstanding school and not a requires improvement school. Interestingly, the London effect is similar to the disadvantage effect.\nPlotting schools and their observed Progress 8 values against the model estimates - Figure 31 - it is clear to see which schools are doing well relative to the model predictions based on their observed persistent absence, rates of disadvantage, ofsted rating and region.\n\nGreen dots are the model estimates. Blue and Red dots are the observed school values.\nObserved values vertically above their modelled green dots are known as positive residuals and show schools which, given their circumstances, are doing better than expected. Those below their dots - negative residuals - are doing worse.\nBACA, despite the challenges it faces, has a large residual value and shows it is doing well, relative to what we would expect.\nPatcham, despite the relative benefits afforded by lower levels of persistent absence, disadvantage and being a good school, does worse than we would expect.\nNearly all other schools in the city are doing better than the model would have predicted with positive residuals. This shows that despite the challenges faced by most Brighton schools, they are doing well relative to the factors that might otherwise hinder their progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel3 &lt;- lm(P8MEA ~ PPERSABS10 + PTFSM6CLA1A, data = btn_sub)\n\n#summary(model3)\n\n#vif_values &lt;- car::vif(model3)\n#vif_values\n\nsumm(model3, scale = F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n10\n\n\nDependent variable\nP8MEA\n\n\nType\nOLS linear regression\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nF(2,7)\n17.97\n\n\nR²\n0.84\n\n\nAdj.

Very high probability that any observations of influence of disadvantage at city level, actually to do with absence instead (given what we have observed at the national level - absence more important than disadvantage).\nTwo variable model for Brighton shows that absence dominates - statistically significant predictor of Progress 8. In the presence of this relationship, disadvantage becomes statistically insignificant (and weirdly positive).\nIn Brighton then, despite there being a high correlation between disadvantage and absence, absence is far more important and essentially invalidates any perceived effects on attainment that we may think disadvantage has.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression models allow us to take the same underlying principles for making associations between continuous variables as scatter plots, but allow us to do so in multiple dimensions at the same time.\nMultiple regression is particularly useful as including a number of independent variables at the same time in a model allows for their effects on the dependent variable to be evaluated at the same time. This is particularly useful when there might be some degree of correlation between independent variables such as in our case with persistent absence and disadvantage.\nLevels of correlation between these two variables were not high enough to cause problems of double counting (known as ‘multicollinearity’ in statistical terms) but enough that any apparent effects of disadvantage are overridden by the more important absence factors.\nThe importance of being an outstanding school or not a require improvement school came through in the modelling. Again, as these effects were assessed at the same time as the effects of attendance and disadvantage, these effects can be seen as in addition to, rather than affected by, these factors. This is an important distinction to make: outstanding schools have a positive effect on Progress 8 attainment levels, regardless of their levels of disadvantage or absence. Requires improvement schools, on the other hand, tend to have a negative effect on Progress 8, despite these other factors.\nGiven these clear statistical patterns and earlier plots show definitively, any policy which fails to tackle persistent absence is likely to make very little impact on attainment levels in Brighton and Hove. As the Attainment 8 plots show - Figure 12 - policies that zoom in on disadvantage and try to adjust distributions and concentrations are likely to only have positive impact on the schools where concentrations are reduced below 20%.\nBrighton’s city average disadvantage rates are too high to make any noticeable positive impact on attainment even if all schools were levelled to the city average - a reduction from 50% to 25% will make only marginal impact on Attainment 8.\nif levels of absence are increased, it is clear that these negative impacts will easily cancel out any marginal gains from\nGood and outstanding schools can and often are good and outstanding regardless of the challenges faced by the cohorts of students they teach. Policies that focus on bringing requires improvement schools up will have a far greater impact on attainment levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, not only is Brighton and Hove City Council misdiagnosing the malady and trying to prescribe an incredibly unpopular treatment (moving students away from their local schools and manufacturing a situation where up to 30% of students in the city have to attend schools outside of their catchment), it is also the case that the treatment is actually highly likely to make things MUCH WORSE.\nThe policies in the consultation, especially the 20% open ballot, will lead to up to 30% of the students in the city attending schools outside their catchment. For many, attending schools outside of catchment will mean long journeys on public transport with distance of travel to school having a direct impact on attendance, as will be shown below.\nThe scale of the deliberate displacement proposed, however, is unprecedented. The council have tried to argue that they have ‘never guaranteed a place at any school to any student’ - which I’m sure is true. But to my mind they have also never actively engaged in trying to stop students from attending their local schools in the name of an ill-conceived educational experiment. And they have also stated in the past that their broad aim is to match the number of places in a catchment area to the number of students in the catchment area - this is a significant departure.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndisplacement_cumulative_long &lt;- displacement_cumulative %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(`2026`, `2027`, `2028`, `2029`, `2030`), \n               names_to = \"year\", \n               values_to = \"value\") %&gt;%\n  filter(number_categories %in% c(\"20% Choice Marginal Ballot\", \"10% Displaced by Marginal Ballot\"))\n\npupils_data &lt;- displacement_cumulative %&gt;%\n  select(number_categories, `2026`, `2027`, `2028`, `2029`, `2030`) %&gt;%\n  filter(number_categories == \"Pupils\") %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(`2026`, `2027`, `2028`, `2029`, `2030`), \n               names_to = \"year\", \n               values_to = \"pupils_value\")\n\ncombined_data &lt;- merge(displacement_cumulative_long, pupils_data, by = c(\"number_categories\", \"year\"))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = pupils_data, aes(x = year, y = pupils_value), stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightgrey\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_bar(data = displacement_cumulative_long, aes(x = year, y = value, fill = number_categories), stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative numbers of displaced pupils by 2030 (council estimates)\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Pupils\",\n       fill = \"Number Categories\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"20% Choice Marginal Ballot\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"10% Displaced by Marginal Ballot\" = \"#33a02c\", \"Total Pupils Affected\" = \"lightgrey\"))  # Custom colors for categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf implemented in 2026, 454 students will be permitted to attend out of catchment schools through ‘choice’ (inverted commas as for some, a 4th choice will be a low down priority, but still treated above that of a 1st choice, non-sibling, non-FSM child within catchment). As a result of this ‘choice’ a further 223 children will be displaced from their own catchments as there will be no places left at their catchment schools.\nIn the first year, the total number of displaced students will be 677 - according to the figures released by the council (student estimates, multiplied by published probabilities).\nEach subsequent year a similar number of students is added to the travel pile until in 2030, 3,234 students every day have to travel to schools outside of their catchment area. 1/3 of the city’s student population.\nWe know the council is having serious financial challenges at present and it has a statutory duty to pay the bus fares for all journeys greater than 3-miles. In Brighton and Hove, currently the annual cost of a bus ticket is currently £445 - so even if, say, 1,000 of those 3,234 students travel over 3-miles, this will be an annual cost to the Council of £445,000.\nI will not reiterate the environmental, social and community impacts of this as they have been voiced many times and they alone should be enough to make the council pause. However, here I am just focusing on educational outcomes, so let’s look at those.\n\n\n\n\n\nPupils who live further away from their school are absent more often. This is a fact derived from analysis from the fft Education Data Lab here.\n\n\n\nDisadvantaged Students in furthest fifth miss up to 2% more sessions than those in the nearest fifth. This is equivalent to -0.1 Progress 8 score in Brighton, just from being further away. And this is a reliable estimate as the relationship between P8 and Persistent Absence is statistically significant in Brighton.\nThis is on-top of all of the other negative impacts on the city of forced travel.\nRelationship between disadvantage and Progress 8 in Brighton is statistically insignificant in our study year, so impossible to know impacts of changing FSM distributions through forced out-of-catchment movements\nPolicy is a total gamble on benefits, but clear and reliable detriment on attainment scores across the city for those subjected to it.",

    "text": "Now at this point, you’d be forgiven for shouting “well that’s bloody obvious, I could have told you that!” - which makes it all the more surprising that it has barely surfaced in the narrative during this whole Brighton Secondary School Admissions engagement/consultation process.\nI genuinely don’t know why it hasn’t, but again the rush to consultation and a general lack of due care and attention in gathering relevant evidence throughout, are probably in the blame line-up - of course assuming that the publicly stated aims actually align with a desire to conduct evidence-based policy.\n\n\nI could get all academic and cite a bunch of papers and government reports, at this juncture, which detail the important role that absence/attendance plays in educational outcomes over and above everything else, but we’ve “had enough of experts”, right? . No? Oh OK then. First up a recent report for the Government’s Social Mobility Commission, where (Riordan, Jopling, and Starr 2021a) state:\n\n“Our statistical models indicate that the strongest predictive factor of the progress made by pupil premium [disadvantaged] students is the school’s absence rate”\n\n\n“schools with lower absence rates have smaller progress gaps; pupil premium students progress more at schools with lower absence rates; This correlation is regardless of whether they begin with low, medium or high rates of absence.”\n\n\n“These findings concur with previous research and we share their interpretation too, that this correlation is most likely to be causal. This is because there is an intuitive underlying causal mechanism: students not in school are less likely to learn the school curriculum.”\n\nNext, (Claymore 2023b) (already citied above) in a paper titled: “Being Present: the Power of Attendance and Stability for Stability for Disadvantaged Pupils” states:\n\n“On average, the association between being absent from school and KS4 outcomes is worse for disadvantaged pupils than their more affluent peers”\n\n\n“Supporting secondary schools to reduce absence, improve behaviour and support within-secondary phase transfers are all key areas of policy focus to boost outcomes of disadvantaged pupils and reduce group gaps in progress and attainment.”\n\n\n“over half of the gap in outcomes between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers is associated with the underlying group differences in absence, exclusion and pupil transfer rates. Improving these underlying factors for disadvantaged pupils should therefore substantially boost outcomes for the group”\n\nI could also go on to cite work by the National Governance Association (NGA 2024) on improving School Attendance, or the Department for Education’s extensive resources on why improving school attendance is important(DfE 2023) (DfE 2024), or this excellent paper by (Klein et al. 2024), but I think you are starting to get the picture. It makes sense, right? If you don’t go to school, it’s harder to learn and achieve.\nSo the literature clearly says absence is important but:\n\nIs absence from school important for Brighton and Hove?\nAnd if it is, is it more or less important than concentrations of disadvantage in schools in the city?\n\nFortunately, as has been the case throughout this whole engagement/consultation exercise, data and analysis can shed some light and help us answer these questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are lots of different reasons why students miss school, for example to attend medical appointments, illness, religious observance, study leave etc. these are likely to be counted as valid reasons and ‘authorised’ by schools. Then there are reasons that are ‘unauthorised’ and these might include things like going on holiday, but also apply to students that might have to stay home to care for family members as well as truancy - i.e. intentionally missing school without permission to be absent.\nReasons for truancy or ‘school refusal’ can be complex and vary between different children, and I won’t go into them here (various sources of information elsewhere if you are interested, including here), but one of the ways in which longer-term absence is measured is if more than 10% of the sessions in a school year are missed. This is often referred to as ‘Persistent Absence’ in the data and this is what we will zoom in on here (rather than other types of authorised or unauthorised absence).\n\n\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) publishes various datasets online which cover things like attainment and absence at both the Local Authority level and at the level of individual schools. We will start with this dataset - https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/data-catalogue/data-set/be024b4d-4f91-40e4-8a58-50dc53dcc93f - “Absence by geographic level - autumn and spring terms combined” which allows us to look at absence in secondary schools across all local authorities from 2016 until 2023.\nQuestion: What is the national picture of persistent absence and how does Brighton and Hove compare?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#unauthorised absence\n\n#https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/data-catalogue/data-set/be024b4d-4f91-40e4-8a58-50dc53dcc93f\n\n##school performance\n#https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/\n\n\n#from here -

Brighton and Hove and England Overlaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are couple of things worth pointing out in Figure 1 above:\n\nThe problem of persistent absence has increased massively since 2016/17, with stark change in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic, where the median persistent absence had been declining and has reduced to about 12% by 2020, but shot up to over 25% after COVID and is still at about 24% in the most recent data for 2023/24.\nAt the same time, the variance has increased (meaning the median is less representative of the whole data) - with more Local Authorities having rates of persistent absence well above average, with some having over 1/3 of students missing 10% or more of school.\nFor Brighton and Hove this situation is bad. Persistent absence has been above average since 2016/17 and while it had declined to only just above the national average in 2020/21, since the Pandemic, the rates of persistent absence have been well above the national average, in 2023/24 topping out at 28%, 4% above the national average of 24%.\n\n\n\nCode\nabsence_2023 &lt;- absence_secondary %&gt;%\n  filter(year == \"2023\")\n\n\nmean_value &lt;- mean(absence_2023$enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, na.rm = TRUE)\nsd_value &lt;- sd(absence_2023$enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nabsence_2023 &lt;- absence_2023 %&gt;%\n  mutate(deviation_status = case_when(\n    enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &lt; mean_value - 1.96 * sd_value ~ \"Below 1.96 SD\",\n    enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &gt; mean_value + 1.96 * sd_value ~ \"Above 1.96 SD\",\n    enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &lt; mean_value - 1.65 * sd_value & enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &gt;= mean_value - 1.96 * sd_value ~ \"Below 1.65 SD\",\n    enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &gt; mean_value + 1.65 * sd_value & enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent &lt;= mean_value + 1.96 * sd_value ~ \"Above 1.65 SD\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Within 1.65 SD\"\n  ))\n\niqr_values &lt;- quantile(absence_2023$enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, probs = c(0.25, 0.75), na.rm = TRUE)\nlower_bound &lt;- iqr_values[1]\nupper_bound &lt;- iqr_values[2]\n\n\nggplot(absence_2023, aes(x = enrolments_pa_10_exact_percent, fill = deviation_status)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.8, position = \"identity\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value, color = \"black\", linetype = \"solid\", size = 1) +\n  #geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value + 1.96 * sd_value, color = \"#E41A1C\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  #geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value - 1.96 * sd_value, color = \"#E41A1C\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  #geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value + 1.65 * sd_value, color = \"#377EB8\", linetype = \"dotted\", size = 1) +\n  #geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value - 1.65 * sd_value, color = \"#377EB8\", linetype = \"dotted\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = lower_bound, color = \"#377EB8\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = upper_bound, color = \"#377EB8\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 28.19426, color = \"#4DAF4A\", linetype = \"solid\", size = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 28.19426, y = 6, label = \"Brighton and Hove\", color = \"#4DAF4A\", angle = 90, vjust = 1.5, hjust = 0) +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of Persistent Absentees - 10% or More Sessions \\nMissed (2023/24) for State-funded Secondary Schools\",\n       x = \"Percentage of Persistent Absentees\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       fill = \"Deviation Status\") +  # Change legend title\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Below 1.96 SD\" = \"#FF7F00\", \"Above 1.96 SD\" = \"#FF7F00\", \n                               \"Below 1.65 SD\" = \"#984EA3\", \"Above 1.65 SD\" = \"#984EA3\", \n                               \"Within 1.65 SD\" = \"#A6CEE3\"))  # Use custom colors for SD classifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Persistent Absence in State Secondary Schools, All Local Authorities in England 2023/24.

Cardinal Newman, Patcham, Dorothy Stringer and Blatchington Mill are all very close to the national average.\nKing’s School and Varndean have better/lower persistent absence rates than average - King’s much lower.\nAt the other end of the scale, PACA and Hove Park have noticably above-average/worse persistent absence rates, while Longhill has 42.4% of students persistently absent with BACA an outlier with an incredibly high rate of 51.8% making it a school suffering from one of the the highest rates of persistent absence in the country.\nThe high, above average, city-levels of persistent absence over time shown at the local authority level, appear to be being driven mainly by students who attend two schools - Longhill and BACA\n\n\n\n\n\nData from here - https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-4-performance/2022-23\nWhile we are here, it will be useful to look at the disadvantaged pupil picture in the same way. This is because later on we will compare the effects that both disadvantage and absence have on attainment to see which is more important both nationally and in the city.

    "text": "Measuring attainment is tricky. Absolute attainment (number of A*s at GCSE - sorry, I know we don’t have A*s anymore, showing my age, but you know what I mean) is a crude measure as it fails to take any account of the diversity of schools and their cohorts, so for a number of years now the preferred measure of attainment has been to look at the ‘value added’ by schools to their pupils by essentially comparing the levels of attainment of pupils when they leave secondary school after their GCSEs, with the levels of attainment they came in with after Primary School.\nThe standard measure of ‘value added’ used by the government for the last few years is something called the “Progress 8” score. “The score is calculated for each student by comparing their GCSE (or equivalent) results with the results of peers who achieved a similar level of attainment at the end of primary school” (Riordan, Jopling, and Starr 2021b). This is done across 8 subjects/qualifications (hence the name), with England and Maths given a double weighting. It is a ratio centred on Zero and generally ranges between -1 and +1 for most schools (when aggregated to school level).\nProgress 8 has been criticised as a measure for various reasons, including its perceived volatility, however the general conclusions in the literature are, it’s not perfect, but it’s certainly better than the old measure of counting students achieving 5 A*-C grades - various pieces including by (Prior et al., n.d.) and (Beynon 2024) here, and here if you want to follow up. And in an Institute for Fiscal Studies report, (Britton, Clark, and Lee 2023) evaluate the effectiveness of using Progress 8 and also conclude that\n“controlling for prior attainment alone is sufficient to produce accurate estimates, and we find no compelling evidence to suggest that the government’s current effectiveness measure, Progress 8, is unreliable. Given its relative simplicity, Progress 8 is a usable measure for teachers and schools, leading us to conclude that there is a limited case for reform based on our data.”\nSo most of what follows will relate to Progress 8. However, since the first pass at this I’ve been into the council and seen Jacob Taylor, Richard Barker and others. Jacob was concerned that Progress 8 incorporates disadvantage into the measure - it doesn’t quite as it simply measures progress between KS2 and KS4 for pupils relative to the national picture and as we’ll see below, while there is some correlation between P8 and disadvantage, it’s weak. It simply acknowledges that some students start KS3 at higher and lower points. However, to assuage those fears, I’ll also look briefly at Attainment 8 - which is the measure of raw attainment, not accounting for prior attainment.\n\n\nCode\n# ggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(x = P8MEA)) +\n#   geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = \"#b3cde3\", color = \"black\") +  # Pastel color for the bars\n#   labs(title = \"Distribution of P8MEA\",\n#        x = \"P8MEA\",\n#        y = \"Count\") +\n#   theme_minimal()\n\nmedian_value &lt;- median(england_school_2022_23_not_special$P8MEA, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\nbtn_sub &lt;- btn_sub %&gt;%\n  mutate(SCHNAME.x = factor(SCHNAME.x, levels = SCHNAME.x[order(P8MEA, decreasing = T)]))\n\n#btn_sub[,c(\"SCHNAME.x\",\"P8MEA\")]\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(x = P8MEA)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = \"grey\", alpha = 0.4) +  # New color for the bars with added transparency\n  geom_vline(xintercept = median_value, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dotted\", size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 Measure Across the Full 2022/23 Academic Year - \\n(All Secondary Schools England, Brighton overlaid)\",\n       x = \"Progress 8 Measure\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       color = \"School (ordered highest Progress8)\") +  # Change legend title to \"School\"\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_vline(data = btn_sub, aes(xintercept = P8MEA, color = SCHNAME.x), linetype = \"solid\", linewidth = 1) +  # Solid vertical lines colored by SCHNAME.x\n  scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(10, \"Set3\")) +  # Use Set3 palette for high contrast with 10 colors\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", size = 0.2, linetype = \"solid\", color = \"black\")) + guides(col = guide_legend(nrow = 4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Progress 8 across all schools in England, 2022/23 with Brighton and Hove schools overlaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations - Figure 6\n\nNote, these are not the latest Progress 8 scores from 2023/24 - these have just been publilshed, but not with useful comparative data for the same year yet, so I’m sticking to 2022/23 for now. However, if you want to look at the latest Progress 8 Scores for Brighton Schools, you can see them here. Of note in 2023/24, however, is the fact that of the schools performing below average, BACA has made a notable improvement from -0.5 to -0.4 in the latest P8 stats. Longhill has declined further from -0.62 to -0.7 and Patcham has declined from -0.21 to -0.45. At the other end of the scale, of those above average, Blatchington Mill has improved from 0.03 to 0.3.\nAs Progress 8 scores are relative to a national average, the distribution around the mean of 0 is about as normal as you might get and the distribution of Brighton schools around this mean is also pretty normal with as many schools above as below average.\nLonghill has the worst Progress 8 scores in the City in 2022/23, with BACA performing slightly better at that time, although with BACA improving and Longhill declining in 2024, the gap between these schools has increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Attainment 8 across all schools in England, 2022/23 with Brighton and Hove schools overlaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations - Figure 7\n\nAttainment 8 is simply raw attainment scores at the end of KS4, not accounting for prior achievement.\nThe histogram is a slightly odd shape with long-tails (i.e. a large number of small counts of schools stretching out to the extremes of the plot). This means when we compare with other data which are more normally distributed, some non-linear patterns might emerge.\nAs far as Brighton and Hove are concerned, however, the majority of schools in the city achieve above the national median for Attainment 8 - which brings us back to my observations in past pieces that in raw attainment terms, Brighton is an above-average city. Only Longhill and BACA are achieving below average.",

    "text": "In a deputation to Labour Cabinet on 6th December 2024, representatives from Class Divide aimed an arrow at ‘apparently sophisticated analysis’ from groups in the city opposed to elements of the council’s proposals.\nWhat I hope to offer below is not particularly sophisticated as hopefully you will be able to see with your own eyes the patterns that the data on Absence, Disadvantage and Attainment reveals and arrive at the same interpretations I have.\nBeing unsophisticated does not mean that I will assume an understanding of some of the more esoteric mathematical dimensions of this analysis, but I will try to keep it as simple as I can and please email me at the address at the top of this piece if you have any questions or queries.\n\n\nTo begin with, I will start with a simple scatter plot. We probably all drew these by hand in science at some point in school. You may have even had a go at drawing a line of best-fit through the points with a ruler (I remember my teachers getting us to do this). The idea is the line is our best attempt at summarising the pattern shown by the dots in the scatter plot, and can be thought of as the average of all the points.\nThe plot below in Figure 8 is a scatter plot, with each point representing a school in England. The y-axis (vertical) has the average Progress 8 score at the end of KS4 for that school in 2022/23. In this plot, the x-axis (horizontal) represents the % of enrolments at that school that are persistently absent (over 10% of sessions missed) in the same year.\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\n\nlm_model &lt;- lm(P8MEA ~ PPERSABS10, data = england_school_2022_23_not_special)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1, 1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[2, 1], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) +  \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence %, All Schools, England, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Enrollments who are persistently absent\",\n       y = \"Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 100, y = Inf, label = paste(\"Intercept:\", intercept, \"\\nSlope:\", slope, \"\\nR²:\", r_squared), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 2, size = 5, color = \"black\") +\n  xlim(0, 100)\n\n\n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_persabs.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the plot and all points together, it should hopefully be clear that on the whole, as the % of enrolments who are persistently absent increases, the value of the Progress 8 score decreases. The more a school has high levels of persistent absence, the lower its Progress 8 score is likely to be. There are, of course, a few weird values (outliers) which don’t follow this trend, but most do.\nThe blue line through the centre of the plot is the line of best-fit (also known as the ‘regression’ line). This is drawn by the computer by minimising the total sum of the squared vertical distances (known as residuals) between each black dot in the plot and the blue line itself. In doing this it ends up with the sum of the positive (dots above the line) and negative residuals (dots below the line) equalling zero.\nThe blue line has two properties that are useful for helping us describe the cloud of points it is representing:\n\nThe first is known as the ‘intercept’. This is the value on the y-axis of the blue line as it crosses zero. In our example, it can be thought of as the value of Progress 8 we would expect for a school if it had 0% persistent absence. Our average best-case Progress 8, if you like. In our case, this value would be 1.06.\nThe second is known as the ‘slope’. This is the change in the value of \\(y\\) (Progress 8) for a one-unit change (1% persistent absence) on the \\(x\\)-axis. In our example, the slope is -0.04. This means that for every additional 1% of students that are persistently absent, on average, the Progress 8 score for that school will reduce by -0.04.\nThe other way of thinking about the slope is how much effect \\(x\\) (persistent absence) is having on \\(y\\) (Progress 8) - if there is there is a causal relationship (which I will return to below). The higher the value of the slope, the more effect \\(x\\) is having on \\(y\\), the lower the value, the less effect it is having. It’s worth also noting that the slope value is in units of \\(x\\).\n\nOn the plot above, I have calculated one more useful property of the points which statisticians know as the \\(R^2\\). In lay terms, this is a number between 0-1 that describes how good a representation of the points the blue line is. The closer the points hug the line, the closer to 1 the value gets. If all of the black points fell exactly on the line, the \\(R^2\\) = 1. Another way of describing the blue line is it’s a model (a representation) of the black points. The closer to 1 our \\(R^2\\) value is, the better our model is and the more reliable it is at describing the underlying relationship.\nOur blue line (model) has an \\(R^2\\) = 0.47. Another way of thinking about this is to say that 47% of the variation in Progress 8 scores between schools can be explained just by the variation in persistent absence. So almost 50%. In statistical terms, this is a very good model. The relationship between Progress 8 and persistent absence is very strong.\nOne note of caution with interpreting relationships like this is often it is easy to confuse correlation (things going up or down together) with causation (\\(x\\) causing \\(y\\), rather than \\(y\\) causing \\(x\\)). This is something all researchers need to be aware of and careful to identify clear theoretical reasons behind suggested relationships. However, in this particular case, the causal pathways are clear. As (Riordan, Jopling, and Starr 2021c) (cited earlier) states: “this correlation [between absence and attainment] is most likely to be causal. This is because there is an intuitive underlying causal mechanism: students not in school are less likely to learn the school curriculum.”\nBrighton Schools have been overlaid - I will return to this in more detail later, but it is worth commenting that most are above the regression line. Positive residuals. This means relative the the levels of persistent absence they are experiencing, they are, on the whole, doing better than most other schools in similar situations, nationally.\nSo this simple plot actually contains a lot of information:\n\nWe know that Persistent Absence explains almost 50% of the variance in Progress 8 scores at the school level in England in 2022/23.\nWe know that, on average, reducing persistent absence in a school by 1% will likely increase their Progress 8 score by 0.04. 10% reduction in persistent absence will lead to a Progress 8 increasing by 0.4.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(mgcv)\n\n# fit a generalised additive model\n\n# lm_model &lt;- gam(ATT8SCR ~ PPERSABS10, data = england_school_2022_23_not_special)\n# lm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\n# lm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$p.coeff\n# intercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1], 2)\n# slope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[2], 2)\n# r_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.sq, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = ATT8SCR, x = PPERSABS10)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", se = TRUE) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, colour = \"red\") + geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = ATT8SCR, x = PPERSABS10, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence %, all schools in England, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Enrollments who are persistently absent\",\n       y = \"Attainment 8 measure\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  xlim(0, 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlm_model &lt;- lm(log(ATT8SCR) ~ log(PPERSABS10), data = england_school_2022_23_not_special)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1, 1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[2, 1], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", se = TRUE) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ exp(-0.05*x), se = TRUE, colour = \"red\") + geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence %, all schools in England, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"log(% Enrollments who are persistently absent)\",\n       y = \"log(Attainment 8 measure)\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2.5, y = 4, label = paste(\"Intercept:\", intercept, \"\\nSlope:\", slope, \"\\nR²:\", r_squared), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 2, size = 5, color = \"black\") + \n  ylim(2,5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Log-Log plot Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to note about the Attainment 8 data and its relationship to Persistent Absence is, in its raw form, it is not a linear relationship, but rather an inverse power-law relationship. This can be seen with the model curve estimate overlaid in red.\nWhat this means in practice is that in raw-attainment terms, once a school gets below about 25% persistent absence, for every 1% point reduction in absence, the corresponding improvement in Attainment 8 gets magnified.\nAt the other end of the distribution, once a school gets above about 35% persistent absence, further increases in persistent absence won’t reduce average Attainment 8 much further - which makes sense as at some point, even just turning up and completing an exam will lead to a minimum grade. Very rarely will Attainment 8 dip below 25.\nTaking the log of both Attainment 8 and Persistent absence allows us to view this inverse power law relationship as a more conventional straight-line. We can see this in Figure 10 which is known as a log-log plot.\nBrighton Schools have been overlaid - and as with Progress 8, it is a similar story with Attainment 8: most are above the regression line. Positive residuals again. To re-iterate, this means relative to the levels of persistent absence they are experiencing, Brighton schools are, on the whole, doing better than most other schools in similar situations, nationally.\n\n\n\n\nOK, now we’re warmed up, here’s a very similar scatter plot, but this time plotting the % of disadvantaged students at a school relative to Progress 8. You might notice some similarities and some differences and I will highlight the ones I think relevant below.\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\n\nlm_model &lt;- lm(P8MEA ~ PTFSM6CLA1A, data = england_school_2022_23_not_special)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1, 1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[2, 1], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PTFSM6CLA1A)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE) + \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PTFSM6CLA1A, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 vs % Percentage of Disadvantaged Students, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Percentage of Disadvantaged Students\",\n       y = \"Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 100, y = Inf, label = paste(\"Intercept:\", intercept, \"\\nSlope:\", slope, \"\\nR²:\", r_squared), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 2, size = 5, color = \"black\") +\n  xlim(0, 100)\n\n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_persabs.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Progress 8 vs % Disadvantaged across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing to note is there is also a negative correlation in this graph. As the proportion of disadvantaged students a school has goes up, on average, the progress 8 score goes down.\nHowever, hopefully you will have noticed a few differences between this plot and the first one.\n\nSlope - the slope of the blue line is shallower. This means that (assuming a causal relationship), on average, having a higher concentration of disadvantaged students in a school has a less severe negative impact on Progress 8. A 1% increase in disadvantaged students will only lead to a 0.01 decrease in Progress 8 (compared to a 0.04 decrease for persistent absence).\nIntercept - the intercept is 0.36, which means that, on average, if a school had 0% disadvantaged students, it might expect a Progress 8 score of 0.36. This is compared to an intercept of 1.06 for Persistent absence, again, suggesting reducing absence rather than disadvantage concentrations is likely to have a greater impact on Progress 8.\n\\(R^2\\) - this is 0.15. So the % of disadvantaged students in a school can only predict 15% of the variation in Progress 8 scores (compared to 47% for Persistent Absence). It is also possible to see this visually - the cloud of points in this plot are far more dispersed than in the earlier plot, showing visually the weaker relationship.\n\nWe will look at this in more detail later, but for Brighton the relationship between progress 8 and disadvantage is broadly negative, but it is clear that it is not a straightforward linear relationship at all.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\n\nlm_model &lt;- lm(ATT8SCR ~ exp(-0.05*PTFSM6CLA1A), data = england_school_2022_23_not_special, , na.action = na.omit)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1,1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1,2], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = ATT8SCR, x = PTFSM6CLA1A)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = ATT8SCR, x = PTFSM6CLA1A, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", se = TRUE) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ exp(-0.05*x), se = T, colour = \"red\") +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ exp(-0.09*x), se = T, colour = \"red\") +   #geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula=(y ~ x), se = TRUE, colour = \"green\") + \n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs % Percentage of Disadvantaged Students, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Percentage of Disadvantaged Students\",\n       y = \"Attainment 8 measure\",\n       color = \"Ofsted Rating\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  xlim(0, 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Attainment 8 vs % Disadvantaged across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Remove rows with NA or infinite values after taking log\ncleaned_data &lt;- england_school_2022_23_not_special %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(ATT8SCR) & ATT8SCR &gt; 0 & !is.na(PTFSM6CLA1A) & PTFSM6CLA1A &gt; 0)\n\n# Fit the model again\nlm_model &lt;- lm(log(ATT8SCR) ~ log(PTFSM6CLA1A), data = cleaned_data, na.action = na.exclude)\nlm_summary &lt;- summary(lm_model)\nlm_coefficients &lt;- lm_summary$coefficients\nintercept &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1,1], 2)\nslope &lt;- round(lm_coefficients[1,2], 2)\nr_squared &lt;- round(lm_summary$r.squared, 2)\n\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", se = TRUE) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = T, colour = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A), colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  #geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ exp(-0.09*x), se = T, colour = \"red\") +   #geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula=(y ~ x), se = TRUE, colour = \"green\") + \n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs % Percentage of Disadvantaged Students, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"log(% Percentage of Disadvantaged Students)\",\n       y = \"log(Attainment 8 measure)\",\n       color = \"Brighton Schools\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = Inf, y = 3, label = paste(\"Intercept:\", intercept, \"\\nSlope:\", slope, \"\\nR²:\", r_squared), hjust = 1.1, vjust = 2, size = 5, color = \"black\") + ylim(1, 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Log-Log Attainment 8 vs % Disadvantaged across all schools in England, 2022/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as raw attainment is concerned, we have a similar log-linear relationship between Attainment 8 and disadvantage as we did with Progress 8 and disadvantage. It is also notable again that disadvantage has both a shallower slope (less influential as a predictor of raw attainment) than absence and a weaker correlation with an \\(R^2\\) of 0.27 (compared to 0.56 for Progress 8).\nRelative to all other schools in the country with similar levels of disadvantage, the good schools on the whole perform better than average (positive residuals above the line) and the requires improvement schools worse than we would expect, given their levels of disadvantage).\n\n\n\n\nAt a national level in 2022/23, then, it’s clear that persistent absence is both a better predictor of Progress 8 and Attainment 8 than disadvantage and stands a better chance of being more influential on progress outcomes if reduced in schools. If I were a policy maker and sitting on top of evidence such as this and I wanted to improve educational outcomes using some high-level lever, the most sensible course of action would be to look at persistent absence before getting anywhere near disadvantage.\nIt also points to the premise in the consultation documents I mentioned earlier - that outcomes in the city are being driven by economic advantage - potentially being incorrect. This evidence seems to suggest that while economic advantage/disadvantage might play a part, factors like persistent absence are likely to be playing even more of a part.\nIt’s also the case that once we control for levels of disadvantage and absence and compare schools in Brighton with other schools in England in a similar position, most schools in Brighton are actually performing better than expected most of the time, both on Attainment 8 and Progress 8.\nAs such, some questions you might well be asking at this point are:\n\n“why have we heard nothing about persistent absence from the council or organisations like Class Divide over the last few months?“\n\nand\n\n“why has the council been zooming in on trying to mix students up in the city when a much more important factor and potentially bigger policy win is sitting there being ignored?”\n\nI genuinely don’t know the answers - perhaps they can provide them in due course. But in the meantime let’s dig a little deeper into the data to see if even more questions or observations emerge.",

Which makes intuitive sense - all other things being equal, if no schools had any persistent absence, even though it predicts almost 50% of the variation in P8, the other qualities of Outstanding schools are likely to make their P8 scores better.\nThe slopes also become less steep as you get towards Outstanding. This means that for outstanding schools, even though persistent absence still affects their P8 scores negatively, the effect is less severe than for good, requires improvement or special measures schools, where the effect is sucessively more amplifed.\n\nFor Brighton (see Figure 16 below for a zoomed in view - or here for an interactive version), most of the schools in the city are rated good in 2022/23 (except for Longhill and BACA which are ‘requires improvement’).\n\nThe relationship between persistent absence and attainment, on average, appears no different in Brighton than it does in the rest of the country. It’s slope and intercept are similar to the ‘good schools’ slope for the rest of the country.\nWe already know that BACA and Longhill have serious problems with students who are persistently absent from those schools and it would appear that reducing persistent absence at these schools to anything even near to the city average, would have a big impact on attainment.\nIt’s worth nothing that this is 2022/23 data and in 2023/24, the P8 situation for BACA and Blatchington mill gets better, but worse for Longhill and Patcham.\n\nIn some ways, despite BACA having such dire persistent absence, for a school with that many students not attending on a regular basis, it falls above the city regression line. This means in some senses, it is actually doing better for its students, attainment wise, than we would expect.\nThe opposite is true for Longhill and Patcham - relative to their persistent absence rates, these schools are doing worse than we would expect - they are below the black regression line. Both would still certainly improve if they cut their persistent absence rates, but it is clear that there are other things also going on. More so than in other schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(england_school_2022_23_not_special, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\ngeom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10), method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-1.5, 1.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\") +  # Add linear model line for england_school_2022_23\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Enrollments who are persistently absent\",\n       y = \"Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence, by OfSted Rating, Brighton and Hove Schools Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data &lt;- eng_sch_2022_23_not_special_plus %&gt;%\n  filter(OFSTEDRATING != \"Inadequate\" & !is.na(OFSTEDRATING))\nfiltered_region &lt;- eng_sch_2022_23_not_special_plus %&gt;%\n  filter(OFSTEDRATING != \"Inadequate\" & !is.na(OFSTEDRATING) & !is.na(gor_name))\nbtn_sub &lt;- filtered_region %&gt;%\n  filter(URN %in% btn_urn_list$urn)\n\n\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"log(% Enrollments who are persistently absent)\",\n       y = \"log(Attainment 8 measure)\",\n       color = \"Ofsted Rating\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Add another layer with btn_sub points and labels with sticks\nplot + \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10)), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10)), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-0.5, 0.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\") + \n  ylim(2,5) + xlim(1,6)\n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_persabs.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence, by OfSted Rating, All Schools in England, 2022/23.

Below in Figure 20 and Figure 21 the data are grouped according to region. I have done this as we already know from work in previous weeks, that London is an outlier educationally (generally achieving better attainment scores than the rest of the country and doing better by its most disadvantaged pupils).\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_region, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, colour = gor_name)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +  # Add linear model line for england_school_2022_23\n  labs(title = \"Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Enrollments who are persistently absent\",\n       y = \"Progress 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\",\n       color = \"Region\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Add another layer with btn_sub points and labels with sticks\nplot + \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = P8MEA, x = PPERSABS10, label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-1.5, 1.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\") \n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_persabs.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Progress 8 vs Persistent Absence, by Region, All Schools in England, 2022/23.

Part of this is a function of the small number of schools in the city meaning drawing a reliable regression (bet-fit) line is hard because small changes to just one or two schools can have a big impact on the line.\n\nOne possible interpretation of the shallower line could be that it suggests that reducing persistent absence in the city might have slightly less of an impact on Progress 8 scores than it does in other regions. However, I don’t think this is the correct interpretation.\nHaving a look a what schools are impacting the line - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/oost57whub - it’s possible to observe that the shallowness of the line relative to English regions is a function of the small number of points and BACA performing better than would be expected given the very high number of persistent absentees in the school. Dropping BACA’s Progress 8 from -0.5 to something like -0.65 would bring the line down to something like the regional slopes.\nConversely, BACA’s 2023/24 improvement (although we don’t know the corresponding persistent absence) is likely to make the slope even shallower. So this is not that improving persistent absence in the city would have less impact than it would elsewhere in the country, rather BACA despite a headline ‘below average’ Progress 8 score, is actually doing much better than we would expect given the levels of persistent absence and this is pulling the slope upwards for the city.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Base plot with england_school_2022_23\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_region, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), colour = gor_name)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +  # Add linear model line for filtered_region\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"log(% Enrollments who are persistently absent)\",\n       y = \"log(Attainment 8 measure)\",\n       color = \"Region\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n# Add another layer with btn_sub points and labels with sticks\nplot +\n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10)), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10)), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PPERSABS10), label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-1.5, 1.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Log-Log Attainment 8 vs Persistent Absence, by Region, All Schools in England, 2022/23.

This means that for outstanding schools, having a higher percentage of disadvantaged students makes very little difference to Progress 8 scores. We can contrast that with the similar line in Figure 14 where persistent absence still had a negative impact even for outstanding schools.\n\nWhat this tells us is it’s possible for outstanding schools to mitigate the impact of disadvantage, but if the students aren’t in the school to begin with, no amount of outstanding teaching will remedy that.\n\nThe slope for Brighton is steeper than the slopes for schools grouped by all levels of Ofsted rating. However, zooming in on the plot (Figure 25 - or interactively here) and examining the slope and the points that are influencing it, it is clear that:\n\nthe distribution of the points means the line is not a very reliable summary (it’s a poor model for Brighton and likely statistically insignificant after controlling for levels of absence - we will come to this later.)\nbut looking at Kings, Stringer and Varndean, rather than schools with more disadvantaged students doing worse than expected, it is back to the point I made on advantaged and disadvantaged attainment in the city here - that Brighton and Hove is doing particularly well for its non-disadvantaged students and these schools are helping pull the line up at the top.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#colour = \"#b3cde3\"\n\nplot &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A), colour = OFSTEDRATING)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +  # Add linear model line for england_school_2022_23\n  labs(title = \"Attainment 8 vs Disadvantaged Student %, 2022-23\",\n       x = \"% Percentage of Disadvantaged Students\",\n       y = \"Attainment 8 measure after adjustment for extreme scores\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Add another layer with btn_sub points and labels with sticks\nplot + \n  geom_point(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A)), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_smooth(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A)), method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +  # Add linear model line for btn_sub\n  geom_text_repel(data = btn_sub, aes(y = log(ATT8SCR), x = log(PTFSM6CLA1A), label = SCHNAME.x), color = \"black\", size = 3, nudge_y = c(-0.5, 0.5), force = 10, box.padding = 0.5, max.overlaps = 10, direction = \"both\") + \n  ylim(1,5)\n\n#ggsave(here(\"images\",\"progress8_vs_disadvantage.png\"), width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26: Attainment 8 vs % Disadvantaged, by OfSted Rating, All Schools in England, 2022/23.

The relationship between Attainment 8 and absence is far stronger than it is for disadvantage.\nIn Brighton, it appears that the effect of the relationship between disadvantage and attainment is steeper than for the country average, however, this is an artefact of a number of schools pulling overall attainment up at the top, rather than others pulling it down at the bottom.\nThat said, Longhill consistently performs worse than would be expected on both Progress 8 and Attainment 8, relative to other schools with similar levels of disadvantage. Hove Park has similar levels of deprivation, but crucially, much lower rates of persistent absence and the contrast between the outcomes of the two schools is stark.\nThe point above is a crucial narrative point. We have been told throughout this whole process that it is all about disadvantage, when actually, the evidence is very strongly suggesting that it’s all about absence.\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that the scatters plot in Figure 11 / Figure 23 and Figure 13 / Figure 26 suggest there is a weak relationship between disadvantage and attainment in Brighton should be ringing big alarm bells for Brighton and Hove Council at this point. The consultation is built upon the premise that poor attainment in the city is driven by disadvantage, when the evidence presented here is suggesting at best there a weak association and one which is dwarfed by the persistent absence problem.\nBut one thing we haven’t done yet is look at how much more important persistent absence is than disadvantage and how these compare each other directly and with other factors like Ofsted rating or just being in London. We can also see below in Figure 29 that there is a small amount of positive correlation between absence and disadvantage, so does this matter as well?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29: % Persistent Absent vs % Disadvantaged, All Schools in England, 2022/23.",

    "text": "So far we have explored some of the factors that might affect Progress/Attainment 8 Scores in schools across England through visualisation. This is an incredibly useful starting point - and something I would encourage all of my students to do at the beginning of any piece of similar analysis. But while scatter plots are fantastic at allowing us to explore data with two dimensions (\\(x\\) and \\(y\\)) and while it is possible to explore things in three dimensions (see Figure 30 below), we can’t go beyond 3-dimensions visually and the analysis starts to become awkward.\nFortunately, we have done the ground-work above to allow us to begin to make use of some of the statistics which described our plots, to try to understand how multiple variables can affect attainment and compare them with each other to build a more complete understanding of the relative importance of each of the factors we have already explored in this piece.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nfig &lt;- plot_ly(filtered_data, x = ~PTFSM6CLA1A, y = ~P8MEA, z = ~PERCTOT, color = ~OFSTEDRATING)\nfig &lt;- fig %&gt;% add_markers()\nfig &lt;- fig %&gt;% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = '% Disadvantaged'),\n                     yaxis = list(title = 'Progress 8'),\n                     zaxis = list(title = '% Persistent Absence')))\n\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 30: Progress 8 vs % Persistent Absent vs % Disadvantaged, All Schools in England, 2022/23.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can combine all of the variables we have explored above and look at their combined effects on Progress 8 using a simple multiple linear regression model - the workhorse of all statistical models.\nI’m not going to go into details about regression modelling here - suffice to say, if you are interested, there is a lot of material out there. All of my code for these outputs are in this document. All it is worth saying at this point is, if you were able to understand the ideas around the scatter plots and the lines of best fit from earlier and had a reasonable understanding of things like the slope, the intercept and the \\(R^2\\) , then you have pretty much got everything you need to understand what will come out of a regression model.\nThis is something I was asked about in the recent council meeting - A KEY thing to note about multiple regression models is because they allow you to look at several variables at the same time, where one variable is more important than the others, it will emerge in the analysis. And indeed, where they might overlap a bit (such as with absence and disadvantage) the one that is more important will shine more brightly.\nIn the models I will present below, the variables are the names in the original data file, so to be clear, these are:\n\nP8MEA - School Level Progress 8 Score in 2022/23 at the end of KS4, adjusted for extreme values\nPPERSABS10 - Percent of Pupils who are Persistently Absent (missing over 10% of sessions)\nPTFSM6CLA1A - Percentage of Pupils who are classified as ‘disadvantaged’ - having received Free School Meals at any point in the preceding 6 years.\nOFSTEDRATING - Ofsted rating at the last inspection\ngor_name - name of the Government Office Region the School resides within\n\nIn the regression model, just as in the scatter plots, Progress 8 is the variable on the \\(y\\)-axis. In regression parlance, it is also known as the ‘dependent variable’. In the model, we are trying to see what the combined effect the other variables (\\(x\\)-variables, or independent variables) have on explaining variation in Progress 8.\nWhen we run the model using a piece of standard statistical software (I’m using R here) we get a series of outputs which tell us how well we can explain \\(y\\) (Progress 8). The main outputs are the same as we saw earlier - an intercept value, some estimates of the slope parameters and an \\(R^2\\) for the whole model.\nWe also get some other useful pieces of information -\n\na ‘standard error’ number - this is essentially a numeric representation of how close or far the black dots not on the blue line in Figure 8 and Figure 11 are away from that line. Big standard errors relative to the slope value show that that value is probably not reliable.\na t-statistic. This is useful as it is the slope value divided by the standard error and has the properly of then effectively being standardised and so comparable with other t-values in the model. I often use them as a short-hand for indicating which variables in the model are most important.\na p-value. The p-value is calcuated from the t-statistic and is a shorthand for determining whether a variable is ‘statistically significant’ in the model. I won’t go into the detail now, but the rule-of-thumb frequently used in statistics is if the p-value is less than 0.05, then this says that there is a greater than 0.95 (95%) probability that the slope value / estimate is reliable and a true relationship between the x variable in question and the y variable we are trying to predict. 95% confidence is the usual stamp of approval in a statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n## regression model\n\nlibrary(gglm)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(jtools)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# Create a linear model\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(P8MEA ~ PPERSABS10 + PTFSM6CLA1A + OFSTEDRATING, data = filtered_region)\n\n#summary(model)\n\n#vif_values &lt;- car::vif(model)\n#vif_values\n\nsumm(model, scale = F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n2517 (42 missing obs. deleted)\n\n\nDependent variable\nP8MEA\n\n\nType\nOLS linear regression\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nF(6,2510)\n508.03\n\n\nR²\n0.55\n\n\nAdj.

This is a good model with strong predictive power.\nStandardised t-values indicate which variables are having the most influence on explaining that variation in Progress 8.\n\nPersistent Absence - PPRESABS10 - is the most important variable in the model with a negative t-value of -28.11 (Progress 8 goes down as absence goes up). The next most important is Ofsted-Outstanding with a positive t-value of 18.69 (being in an outstanding school pushes Progress 8 up). The next most important is Ofsted - requires improvement, which has a negative t-value of -11.55.\nThe overall % of disadvantaged students has a negative effect as we would expect, but it is a comparatively small effect compared to these other variables, with a t-value of only -5.48.\n\nThe standardised plot below the tabular output give a visual representation of this overall pattern. Here the coefficients have been scaled so they are not the t-values, but the broad patterns are the same and are perhaps more intuitive to interpret.\nThis model provides a robust statistical corroboration of the patterns we were inferring from the scatterplots earlier in this analysis. Absence, not disadvantage is the most important factor in determining outcomes. This, of course, is exactly what the wider literature was already telling us, but crucially, not the message that was coming out of Brighton and Hove council when we have been told over and again - not based on any evidence - that disadvantage is what needs to be focused on to improve attainment.\nWe can take this model further and add additional variables in to see if we can explain any more of the variation.

We can, of course, keep building this model and adding additional variables in. For now, as we have explained most of the variance in the model, we will not keep going. In future weeks, I may go further, however.\nWhere we have p-values of &gt;0.05, these variables are statistically insignificant, so we can ignore their parameters - they are not influencing the model. This is the case for a lot of the regions, however, London sticks out as it is both statistically significant and positive on its effect on attainment. This aligns with observations we have made in previous weeks about the importance of London in England’s education story.\nMost of the other variables don’t change much with the addition of regions, however the importance of absence decreases slightly (London having low rates of absence, in accounting for it separately in the model, it makes sense that some of that effect from London disappears). Similarly, the affect of disadvantage increases slightly - again, an impact of including London which has very high levels of disadvantage, but also high levels of attainment in that disadvantage, so including London increases the effect elsewhere.\nHowever, even with London in the model, Absence is still the most important factor by far, followed by being an Ofsted outstanding school and not a requires improvement school. Interestingly, the London effect is similar to the disadvantage effect.\nPlotting schools and their observed Progress 8 values against the model estimates - Figure 31 - it is clear to see which schools are doing well relative to the model predictions based on their observed persistent absence, rates of disadvantage, ofsted rating and region.\n\nGreen dots are the model estimates. Blue and Red dots are the observed school values.\nObserved values vertically above their modelled green dots are known as positive residuals and show schools which, given their circumstances, are doing better than expected. Those below their dots - negative residuals - are doing worse.\nBACA, despite the challenges it faces, has a large residual value and shows it is doing well, relative to what we would expect.\nPatcham, despite the relative benefits afforded by lower levels of persistent absence, disadvantage and being a good school, does worse than we would expect.\nNearly all other schools in the city are doing better than the model would have predicted with positive residuals. This shows that despite the challenges faced by most Brighton schools, they are doing well relative to the factors that might otherwise hinder their progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel3 &lt;- lm(P8MEA ~ PPERSABS10 + PTFSM6CLA1A, data = btn_sub)\n\n#summary(model3)\n\n#vif_values &lt;- car::vif(model3)\n#vif_values\n\nsumm(model3, scale = F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n10\n\n\nDependent variable\nP8MEA\n\n\nType\nOLS linear regression\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nF(2,7)\n17.97\n\n\nR²\n0.84\n\n\nAdj.

Very high probability that any observations of influence of disadvantage at city level, actually to do with absence instead (given what we have observed at the national level - absence more important than disadvantage).\nTwo variable model for Brighton shows that absence dominates - statistically significant predictor of Progress 8. In the presence of this relationship, disadvantage becomes statistically insignificant (and weirdly positive).\nIn Brighton then, despite there being a high correlation between disadvantage and absence, absence is far more important and essentially invalidates any perceived effects on attainment that we may think disadvantage has.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple regression models allow us to take the same underlying principles for making associations between continuous variables as scatter plots, but allow us to do so in multiple dimensions at the same time.\nMultiple regression is particularly useful as including a number of independent variables at the same time in a model allows for their effects on the dependent variable to be evaluated at the same time. This is particularly useful when there might be some degree of correlation between independent variables such as in our case with persistent absence and disadvantage.\nLevels of correlation between these two variables were not high enough to cause problems of double counting (known as ‘multicollinearity’ in statistical terms) but enough that any apparent effects of disadvantage are overridden by the more important absence factors.\nThe importance of being an outstanding school or not a require improvement school came through in the modelling. Again, as these effects were assessed at the same time as the effects of attendance and disadvantage, these effects can be seen as in addition to, rather than affected by, these factors. This is an important distinction to make: outstanding schools have a positive effect on Progress 8 attainment levels, regardless of their levels of disadvantage or absence. Requires improvement schools, on the other hand, tend to have a negative effect on Progress 8, despite these other factors.\nGiven these clear statistical patterns and earlier plots show definitively, any policy which fails to tackle persistent absence is likely to make very little impact on attainment levels in Brighton and Hove. As the Attainment 8 plots show - Figure 12 - policies that zoom in on disadvantage and try to adjust distributions and concentrations are likely to only have positive impact on the schools where concentrations are reduced below 20%.\nBrighton’s city average disadvantage rates are too high to make any noticeable positive impact on attainment even if all schools were levelled to the city average - a reduction from 50% to 25% will make only marginal impact on Attainment 8.\nif levels of absence are increased, it is clear that these negative impacts will easily cancel out any marginal gains from\nGood and outstanding schools can and often are good and outstanding regardless of the challenges faced by the cohorts of students they teach. Policies that focus on bringing requires improvement schools up will have a far greater impact on attainment levels.",

    "text": "In this piece I am going to change the focus of the conversation and look at something which has thus far been absent (excuse the pun) from any of the conversations about the school system in Brighton. The issue of absence/attendance and its importance for educational outcomes.\n\n\nThe Council’s premise in the very first slide shown in the engagement exercise back in October, was that Brighton and Hove has a large attainment gap and is failing its most disadvantaged pupils. Now, I have since refuted that claim here and shown that Brighton is not performing badly as a city and indeed is above the national median in terms of disadvantaged attainment.\nHowever, it is clear that disadvantage and attainment is still an important topic for the council. Indeed Cllr Taylor confirmed as much in the presence of other councillors, council officers and the Parent Support Group saying it was his number 1 aim for this whole process.\nThis is supported in the new proposal documentation (supporting documents here) where it states in 3.7 that the council wants a system that:\n\n“delivers children’s outcomes which are good and improving especially for those at risk of disadvantage”\n\nand under 3.9 that:\n\n“the proposals put forward were designed to include: a) Better equality of outcomes – results not driven by economic advantage. b) Deliver a ‘comprehensive’ offer from our city schools as a more mixed pupil intake creates better outcomes for disadvantaged pupils.”\n\n\n\nThe underpinning assumptions in those statements above and the proposals that follow are that:\n\neconomic advantage/disadvantage are the main drivers of results in the city\nthe main remedy is through some kind of economic mixing in intakes\n\nBut in much the same way as when we go to the doctor, we expect an accurate diagnosis and corresponding efficacious treatment, we all know that unfortunately, sometimes, neither diagnosis nor treatment are correct.\nWe know the council’s prescribed treatment has been influenced quite heavily by some of the work of Stephen Gorard (https://theconversation.com/poorer-pupils-do-worse-at-school-heres-how-to-reduce-the-attainment-gap-205535) and a full paper here - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244018825171, but the effect of school level mixing, relative to other factors is small. Here is what Gorard says in the conclusions in his influential paper:\n\n“Whether school composition is a phantom or not, the school-level variables tell a consistent story across the duration of schooling. Pupils do worse in schools with clusters of disadvantage or clusters of prior attainment. Put another way, if this composition is real, then schools should be as mixed as possible both socially and academically. This could lead to improved outcomes of between 0.05 and 0.15 of a standard deviation for almost no cost.”\n\nNow this needs a bit of unpicking.\n\nGorard is not 100% confident that the school-level effect is a real one. The “Phantom” being referred to in the paper is the fact that measuring pupil-level data and characteristics could be imprecise and when aggregated up to the school level, might give misleading impressions.\nBut if we accept that it is real - and let’s just say it is - then increased mixing in schools could lead to improved outcomes of between 0.05 and 0.15 of a standard deviation - now Gorard says “for almost no cost”, perhaps a better way of phrasing this would be “assuming no cost” - as the means by which increasing mixing in schools occurs could come at quite high cost - particularly as we have seen in Brighton where the mechanism is essentially via long-distance busing of children between catchment areas. This is likely to incur quite considerable costs for children (tiredness, anxiety, reluctance to attend if school far away etc.)\nIn the case of Brighton and Hove, we can put a real number on 0.05 and 0.15 of a standard deviation in approved attainment? In 2022-23 the mean school - level Attainment 8 score was 47.56 (in England it was 45.9). The standard deviation (how much, on average, the attainment 8 scores in the city vary around that mean) was 6.92 (in England, 7.23). 0.15 (the most improvment Gorard thinks might be possible from increased mixing) of 6.92 = 1.038.\nSo if social mixing can occur at no negative cost, we might expect - at best according to the Gorard paper - a 1pt improvement in the average pupil (and I assume by extension average school-level) Attainment 8 score in 1 subject out of the 10 used to calculate the score. If no negative costs. Although it’s not clear how much of a change in the levels of mixing would be required to affect this 1pt improvement - usually these things relate to a 1-unit change in \\(x\\) (concentration of disadvantaged pupils, but this feels high and is not clear?) for a corresponding change in \\(y\\), but this is not clear in the paper.\nFor context, in Brighton and Hove in 2022-23, Attainment 8 scores at the school level ranged from 35.8 to 54.5. So the effect is at best small, and relative to the range experienced by schools in Brighton (almost 20pts), very small.\n\nSo if there are no negative costs associated with increasing social mixing (and it’s not a phantom effect), we might expect a very small positive impact on attainment by increasing mixing, but we don’t know how much additional mixing (over and above the mixing already present) will be required to reach this maximum benefit of 1 Attainment 8 point.\nIf we look at the level of mixing and segregation in Brighton’s schools already (using the Gorard Segregation Index) - see below - we can observe that Brighton and Hove is already ranked the 44th best (out of 154 LEAs) in England for its levels of disadvantaged integration, so it already has less headroom than other LEAs for improvement.\n\n\nCode\n#all england schools\nedubase_schools &lt;- read_csv(\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fhzafgt27v30lmmuo084y/edubasealldata20241003.csv?rlkey=uorw43s44hnw5k9js3z0ksuuq&raw=1\") %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  filter(phase_of_education_name == \"Secondary\") %&gt;% \n  filter(establishment_status_name == \"Open\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(urn = as.character(urn))\n\n#read in Brighton Secondary Schools Data\nbrighton_sec_schools &lt;- read_csv(\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fhzafgt27v30lmmuo084y/edubasealldata20241003.csv?rlkey=uorw43s44hnw5k9js3z0ksuuq&raw=1\") %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  filter(la_name == \"Brighton and Hove\") %&gt;% \n  filter(phase_of_education_name == \"Secondary\") %&gt;% \n  filter(establishment_status_name == \"Open\") %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(., coords = c(\"easting\", \"northing\")) %&gt;% \n  st_set_crs(27700)\n\nbtn_urn_list &lt;- brighton_sec_schools %&gt;% \n  select(urn) \n\nengland_abs &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_abs.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\nengland_census &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_census.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\nengland_ks4final &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_ks4final.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\nengland_school_information &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_school_information.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\n\nla_codes &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_metadata\", \"2022-2023\", \"la_and_region_codes_meta.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\")) %&gt;% \n  clean_names()\n\nengland_ks4final &lt;- england_ks4final %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(TOTPUPS:PTOTENT_E_COVID_IMPACTED_PTQ_EE, ~ parse_number(as.character(.))))\n\nengland_ks4final &lt;- england_ks4final %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(URN))\n\nengland_abs &lt;- england_abs %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN))\n\nengland_census &lt;- england_census %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN))\n\nengland_school_information &lt;- england_school_information %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN))\n\n# Left join england_ks4final with england_abs\nengland_school_2022_23 &lt;- england_ks4final %&gt;%\n  left_join(england_abs, by = \"URN\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(england_census, by = \"URN\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(england_school_information, by = \"URN\")\n\ndata_types &lt;- sapply(england_school_2022_23, class)\nengland_school_2022_23_meta &lt;- data.frame(Field = names(data_types), DataType = data_types)\n\nbtn_sub &lt;- england_school_2022_23 %&gt;%\n  filter(URN %in% btn_urn_list$urn)\n\n#P8_BANDING\nengland_school_2022_23_not_special &lt;- england_school_2022_23 %&gt;%\n  filter(MINORGROUP != \"Special school\" & ADMPOL.x == \"NSE\")\n\neng_sch_2022_23_not_special_plus &lt;- england_school_2022_23_not_special %&gt;% left_join(\n  edubase_schools, by = join_by(URN == urn)\n)\n\n\ncalculate_index_of_dissimilarity &lt;- function(df) {\n  # Ensure the dataframe has the necessary columns\n  required_columns &lt;- c(\"TFSM6CLA1A\", \"TNOTFSM6CLA1A\")\n  if (!all(required_columns %in% colnames(df))) {\n    stop(\"Dataframe must contain the columns: TFSM6CLA1A and TNOTFSM6CLA1A\")\n  }\n  \n  # Calculate the total number of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils\n  total_disadvantaged &lt;- sum(df$TFSM6CLA1A, na.rm = TRUE)\n  total_non_disadvantaged &lt;- sum(df$TNOTFSM6CLA1A, na.rm = TRUE)\n  \n  # Calculate the index of dissimilarity\n  df$dissimilarity_component &lt;- abs(df$TFSM6CLA1A / total_disadvantaged -

Before prescribing a treatment, should we have not carried out a thorough examination of the patient first in case a more serious underlying ailment is causing the symptoms? This is all before we get anywhere near the negative side effects.\nNot wanting to strain the metaphor further, how do we know for sure that a lack of mixing is indeed the main factor holding back disadvantaged attainment? What if it is not? And if it is not, what is more important? And if there are more important factors, might there be more effective routes to minimising disadvantaged educational outcomes that could offer better (more than a max 1pt improvement in 1 subject at GSCE) or faster results, and indeed do so without the levels of disruption currently on the table?\nThese are very important questions to ask, not least because under the current proposals, one of the experimental ‘treatments’ being prescribed by the council is forced mixing in schools through artificially reducing places in schools for local students and busing (or for at least 1/4 of children, privately driving) significant numbers of students from some neighbourhoods (some by ‘choice’ and some through ‘displacement’ - see the PGS explainer here) to schools a long way from their homes. This kind of forced mixing not only has a questionable history but has huge negative social/community, financial and environmental implications for our city (many of which were raised in the Parent Support Group’s latest deputation at the Labour Cabinet meeting in November) which have thus-far been ignored by those advocating for the proposals.\nAnd as I will show below, the treatment currently being prescribed by the council, worse than being ineffective, is likely worsen attainment across the city - again, at risk of stretching the metaphor too far, this could be akin 19th Century doctors prescribing arsenic for psoriasis (Sarfraz 2023) - it sort of works in some ways, but OH GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer is: Yes, yes there is. The longer answer is there are lots of things; from raw income deprivation or requiring SEN support, to simply moving schools (see p8 of (Claymore 2023a) to see the relative effects of some of these) - all can have some impact on attainment. But there is one factor, over an above everything else, that affects attainment more than any other: Absence from School.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, not only is Brighton and Hove City Council misdiagnosing the malady and trying to prescribe an incredibly unpopular treatment (moving students away from their local schools and manufacturing a situation where up to 30% of students in the city have to attend schools outside of their catchment), it is also the case that the treatment is actually highly likely to make things MUCH WORSE.\nThe policies in the consultation, especially the 20% open ballot, will lead to up to 30% of the students in the city attending schools outside their catchment. For many, attending schools outside of catchment will mean long journeys on public transport with distance of travel to school having a direct impact on attendance, as will be shown below.\nThe scale of the deliberate displacement proposed, however, is unprecedented. The council have tried to argue that they have ‘never guaranteed a place at any school to any student’ - which I’m sure is true. But to my mind they have also never actively engaged in trying to stop students from attending their local schools in the name of an ill-conceived educational experiment. And they have also stated in the past that their broad aim is to match the number of places in a catchment area to the number of students in the catchment area - this is a significant departure.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndisplacement_cumulative_long &lt;- displacement_cumulative %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(`2026`, `2027`, `2028`, `2029`, `2030`), \n               names_to = \"year\", \n               values_to = \"value\") %&gt;%\n  filter(number_categories %in% c(\"20% Choice Marginal Ballot\", \"10% Displaced by Marginal Ballot\"))\n\npupils_data &lt;- displacement_cumulative %&gt;%\n  select(number_categories, `2026`, `2027`, `2028`, `2029`, `2030`) %&gt;%\n  filter(number_categories == \"Pupils\") %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(`2026`, `2027`, `2028`, `2029`, `2030`), \n               names_to = \"year\", \n               values_to = \"pupils_value\")\n\ncombined_data &lt;- merge(displacement_cumulative_long, pupils_data, by = c(\"number_categories\", \"year\"))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = pupils_data, aes(x = year, y = pupils_value), stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightgrey\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_bar(data = displacement_cumulative_long, aes(x = year, y = value, fill = number_categories), stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative numbers of displaced pupils by 2030 (council estimates)\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Pupils\",\n       fill = \"Number Categories\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"20% Choice Marginal Ballot\" = \"#1f78b4\", \"10% Displaced by Marginal Ballot\" = \"#33a02c\", \"Total Pupils Affected\" = \"lightgrey\"))  # Custom colors for categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf implemented in 2026, 454 students will be permitted to attend out of catchment schools through ‘choice’ (inverted commas as for some, a 4th choice will be a low down priority, but still treated above that of a 1st choice, non-sibling, non-FSM child within catchment). As a result of this ‘choice’ a further 223 children will be displaced from their own catchments as there will be no places left at their catchment schools.\nIn the first year, the total number of displaced students will be 677 - according to the figures released by the council (student estimates, multiplied by published probabilities).\nEach subsequent year a similar number of students is added to the travel pile until in 2030, 3,234 students every day have to travel to schools outside of their catchment area. 1/3 of the city’s student population.\nWe know the council is having serious financial challenges at present and it has a statutory duty to pay the bus fares for all journeys greater than 3-miles. In Brighton and Hove, currently the annual cost of a bus ticket is currently £445 - so even if, say, 1,000 of those 3,234 students travel over 3-miles, this will be an annual cost to the Council of £445,000.\nI will not reiterate the environmental, social and community impacts of this as they have been voiced many times and they alone should be enough to make the council pause. However, here I am just focusing on educational outcomes, so let’s look at those.\n\n\n\n\n\nPupils who live further away from their school are absent more often. This is a fact derived from analysis from the fft Education Data Lab here.\n\n\n\nDisadvantaged Students in furthest fifth miss up to 2% more sessions than those in the nearest fifth. This is equivalent to -0.1 Progress 8 score in Brighton, just from being further away. And this is a reliable estimate as the relationship between P8 and Persistent Absence is statistically significant in Brighton.\nThis is on-top of all of the other negative impacts on the city of forced travel.\nRelationship between disadvantage and Progress 8 in Brighton is statistically insignificant in our study year, so impossible to know impacts of changing FSM distributions through forced out-of-catchment movements\nPolicy is a total gamble on benefits, but clear and reliable detriment on attainment scores across the city for those subjected to it.",

    "text": "Following on analysis from my last piece on the importance of absence, this work verifies that posted by Ben Harper on Facebook and shows that for schools in the range of levels of disadvantage that Brighton and Hove experiences, there is NO RELATIONSHIP between attainment, progress and school-level disadvantage concentrations. NO RELATIONSHIP.\nEven if there was no negative collateral damage caused by forcing thousands of children to attend schools outside of their catchment area to affect changes in the proportions of disadvantage in different schools in the city (and there will be lots of negative collateral damage), the evidence from this analysis is there will be NO BENEFIT to disadvantaged attainment of changes to school-level disadvantage concentrations. None.\nHaving examined the original Stephen Gorard paper where the idea for increased social mixing having a positive effect on attainment first emerged, the authors themselves only cite a weak effect from social mixing on attainment. But having identified clear non-linearities in the relationship between attainment and disadvantage at the national school level in the DfE 2022-23 data (see all of the plots below), without verifiable data plots and other indicative regression diagnostics in the Gorard paper, it is possible that the weak linear relationship reported at the national level is not reliable - there is a good chance that it is violating standard linear regression assumptions.\nWhile there is no relationship between concentrations of disadvantage and levels of disadvantaged attainment in the Brighton and Hove range, the evidence below suggests strongly that if persistent absence were reduced - even just for schools in the range of persistent absence that Brighton and Hove experiences - noticeable improvements in disadvantaged attainment could be achieved.\nIn the face of this evidence against any effects at all, can the council continue to justify a policy - specifically the 20% open allocation policy which would lead to 20% of the places in a catchment being allocated to out of catchment children, resulting in the displacement of 10% of students in the city outside of their catchment - on the grounds of trying to improve attainment through mixing?\nIn the face of this evidence, can the council explain why it has not switched its focus to tackling persistent absence in the city and why it has not announced that it will not be pursuing the 20% open ballot policy given the overwhelming likelihood of no positive effects on disadvantaged attainment and significant and numerous negative effects?",

    "text": "Science and Policy\nAll good science proceeds incrementally and builds on the excellent work of others through reproducibility coupled with new perspectives and ideas often brought from other disciplines, societies and cultures. Science is not perfect, but for all of its faults its the best system humans have developed for advancing humanity’s understanding of the world. And to be fair, it has achieved a fair amount in a pretty short space of time.\nAll good policy is evidence-based policy - and to borrow the wikipedia definition (for it is both accessible and good):\n\nAn individual or organisation is justified in claiming that a specific policy is evidence-based if, and only if, three conditions are met:\n\nthe individual or organisation possesses comparative evidence about the effects of the specific policy in comparison to the effects of at least one alternative policy\nthe specific policy is supported by this evidence according to at least one of the individual’s or organisation’s preferences in the given policy area\nthe individual or organisation can provide a sound account for this support by explaining the evidence and preferences that lay the foundation for the claim\n\n\nThe darker, always less successful opposite to evidence-based policy is policy-based evidence making. We can probably all think of examples, but this is where someone might observe something, decide on what they think the best course of action is, formulate a policy to make that thing happen, and then search around to find some evidence to post-hoc justify that policy to people they might have to justify it too.\nRight back at the beginning of the engagement exercise last year, the council stated that its ambitions for the re-organisation of the school admissions system were ‘evidence based’. Since then, much more evidence has arrived that call that into question. Here is some more.",

    "text": "Science and Reproducibility\nReturning to science - in the same way that I apparently inspired some work that Ben Harper posted on Facebook here. I have been inspired to verify and build on this work.\nThat first post was then also followed with another post here where the the relative weakness of the Gorardian association between social mixing and attainment first cited in this paper was highlighted. A factor at the national level - albeit a weak one even acknowledged by the authors.\nHarper’s crucial insight after seeing the non-linear relationship in my work was that Gorard’s weak negative relationship between attainment and disadvantage (leaving aside the chance that the relationship might be in violation of the assumptions of linearity that underpin their validity) might be even weaker if we restrict our analysis to the reality of Brighton and Hove.\nThis is really important. Brighton is a medium sized city and like every other town and city of a reasonable size in the country, has pockets of wealth and affluence. As such, it will never attain the kind of low-levels of disadvantage you might find, say, in a leafy commuter town in Surrey. And because the town does already have relatively well mixed schools in the state sector, it will never have schools with levels of disadvantage lower than the lowest level experienced at the moment while the city-wide levels of disadvantage are projected to increase in the future. If city-wide levels come down, then some schools may also reduce.\nThese insights from Harper are crucial important as they provide strong evidence that for disadvantaged students (those who BHCC have identified as wanting to improve attainment for), no amount of increased or decreased social mixing in schools will make a difference to their progress or attainment at the end of KS4.\nIn the spirit of reproducibility, I have had a go at reproducing Harper’s plots and have extended them a little and looked also at persistent absence as a contract. To be clear: Using data from 2022-23 for all state secondary schools in England, for the range of disadvantage experienced in Brighton and Hove Schools (and we know that levels of disadvantage in the city are likely to increase overall from the Council’s own projections), I agree with Harper that there is NO RELATIONSHIP between the increase or decrease in the total proportion of disadvantaged pupils in those schools and the increase or decrease or both Progress 8 and Attainment 8 scores. NO RELATIONSHIP.\nThere is a weak negative relationship for non-disadvantaged students. This means that through a policy of increased social mixing - even before we try to account for the negative impacts of increased travel which will be used to facilitate the mixing - we can predict that the council might well be successful in reducing the attainment gap in the city, but only through reducing, slightly, the attainment of non-disadvantaged students in those schools where disadvantaged proportions increase. The gap won’t be closed through increasing the attainment of disadvantaged students - this is likely to remain static.\nHOWEVER, it is a different story altogether when we look at persistent absence. If you had read my last piece here you might already be guessing where this is going. Yes, there is a STONG RELATIONSHIP between persistent absence and attainment in the range Brighton and Hove experiences. It is closer to a linear relationship for Progress 8 anyway, but also holds for Attainment 8 which is not a linear relationship, but pretty linear for the Brighton and Hove range.\nWhat is interesting is that the plots below actually corroborate the weak negative associations (and at about the same level - although in Gorard’s paper they use standardised coefficients and don’t provide the raw outputs so we can’t match directly coefficient values) between attainment and disadvantage if we assume a linear relationship. But as the plots show clearly and as Ben Harper pointed out before, this is NOT a linear relationship - and as anyone with undergraduate level training in statistics will tell you, for the coefficients in a linear relationship to be valid and reliable, the variables must have a linear association. So there is strong evidence here - and Gorard’s paper doesn’t provide the kind of visual outputs or regression diagnostics we need to check this for sure - that the big association trumpeted by the council between attainment and concentrations of disadvantage - is neither big nor relevant for schools exhibiting the levels of disadvantage we do in Brighton.\nI will therefore repeat what I said before: If Brighton and Hove Council are serious about wanting to improve the attainment of disadvantaged students in the city, they will not achieve this through changing the concentrations of disadvantage in the schools in the city. Even if all schools had the ‘city average’ for FSM concentrations, the evidence looking at all schools in England is there would be no benefit for the attainment disadvantaged pupils. However, if the council focused on reducing levels of persistent absence, there would be a strong likelihood that the attainment of those pupils would improve - disadvantaged or non-disadvantaged alike.\nExplore the plots below if you would like to see this for yourself.",

    "text": "What does this mean for evidence-based policy?\n\n\nthe individual or organisation possesses comparative evidence about the effects of the specific policy in comparison to the effects of at least one alternative policy\n\n\nThe plots below compare the effects of adjusting levels of disadvantage in schools with adjusting levels of persistent absence in schools on their levels of attainment and progress. This is comparative evidence.\nAdjusting levels of disadvantage in the range that Brighton and Hove experiences has NO EFFECT on attainment.\nAdjusting levels of persistent absence has quite a large effect on attainment.\nWhich might be the more sensible policy target to pursue? Levels of disadvantage or levels of persistent absence?\n\n\nthe specific policy is supported by this evidence according to at least one of the individual’s or organisation’s preferences in the given policy area\n\n\nBHCC clearly has a preference to try and affect change in attainment for disadvantaged pupils through adjusting levels of disadvantage in schools. This work has shown that the evidence this preference is built upon is likely to be flawed (a linear coefficient cited for a non-linear relationship at the national level). Restricting the analysis to the reality of disadvantage in Brighton, it has also shown that for Brighton the any relationship between school-level disadvantage and school-level attainment for disadvantaged pupils, disappears.\n\n\nthe individual or organisation can provide a sound account for this support by explaining the evidence and preferences that lay the foundation for the claim\n\n\nGiven the evidence below and in my last piece, can BHCC provide a sound account for supporting a policy to try and improve disadvantaged attainment based on socially engineering new concentrations of disadvantage in schools - even leaving aside the huge negative impacts such a policy might entail - when it is clear the evidence for an effect is non-existent?\nCan they justify why a new policy based on reducing the levels of persistent absence in the city is not being disucssed or promoted to the community?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n##Absence 2022-23 regression analysis\n\n##All Data downloaded from here\n##https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/\n\n#read in data for every school in the country\n\nengland_abs &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_abs.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\nengland_census &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_census.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\nengland_ks4final &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_ks4final.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\nengland_school_information &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data\", \"Performancetables_Eng_2022_23\", \"2022-2023\", \"england_school_information.csv\"), na = c(\"\", \"NA\", \"SUPP\", \"NP\", \"NE\"))\n\nengland_ks4final &lt;- england_ks4final %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(TOTPUPS:PTOTENT_E_COVID_IMPACTED_PTQ_EE, ~ parse_number(as.character(.))))\n\nengland_ks4final &lt;- england_ks4final %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(URN))\n\nengland_abs &lt;- england_abs %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN))\n\nengland_census &lt;- england_census %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN))\n\nengland_school_information &lt;- england_school_information %&gt;%\n  mutate(URN = as.character(URN))\n\n# Left join england_ks4final with england_abs\nengland_school_2022_23 &lt;- england_ks4final %&gt;%\n  left_join(england_abs, by = \"URN\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(england_census, by = \"URN\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(england_school_information, by = \"URN\")\n\ndata_types &lt;- sapply(england_school_2022_23, class)\nengland_school_2022_23_meta &lt;- data.frame(Field = names(data_types), DataType = data_types)",

    "text": "Fact 2 - Social Mixing\nBrighton and Hove’s schools are already very mixed (relative to other LEAs in England) according to the relative proportions of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils across state secondary schools in the whole city.\nStephen Gorard proposed an Index that some called the ‘Gorard Segregation Index’ which can be used to examine segregation of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students in schools. The formula for calculating it is here - https://sru.soc.surrey.ac.uk/SRU30.html\nThe plot below shows where Brighton sits relative to other LEAs in England on both the Gorard Segregation Index (for disadvantage) and a more standard dissimilarity index for the same variables. 0 = total integration of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students, 1 = total segregation. Brighton and Hove has a Gordard Segregation Index score of 0.13 - ranking it 44th BEST in the country for integration. 110 LEAs have schools which are more segregated.",

    "text": "Factsheet / RoadmapFacts Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts\n\nThe city’s schools already perform well for its children, and we should celebrate this – attainment is above average for both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students. Challenges are isolated and need targeted solutions.\nBrighton schools are already more socially mixed than in 2/3 of other LEAs in the country. The new FSM priority will likely increase the mix of disadvantaged students further.\nThe complex mix of priorities in the proposal makes it hard for families to understand the impact on them. Can you explain them? The School Admissions Code is clear that this is not allowed. It states, “Parents should be able to look at a set of arrangements and understand easily how places for that school will be allocated.”\nStacking of FSM within priorities won’t smooth to city average, but shift concentrations to different schools.\nThe council predicts 250 displaced students in 2026. This includes 144 from the V/DS catchment, 57 from the HP/B catchment, and 44 from Patcham.\nUnder these proposals, after 5 years, once all secondary school year groups are in place, 1,250 children will be displaced from their catchments by 2,000 more opting in via ‘open ballot’. Over 3,000 students (about 1/3 of the city) may be attending schools outside their catchment area, far from home.\nThis displacement is intentional. It happens for several reasons: the proposed open admission priority, changes to catchment areas, fewer places at Dorothy Stringer and Blatchington Mill, and more spots for children eligible for free school meals.\nChildren unable to get a place and living in the catchment areas of Dorothy Stringer/Varndean and Hove Park/Blatchington Mill would then be the lowest priority for places in other schools. They would probably only be able to get a place at one of the schools farthest from where they live. This risk mainly affects children without a sibling in secondary school and who aren’t eligible for free school meals.\nThese children would have to travel much further than is typical in England. Their journeys would exceed those of children in other cities.\nAsking children to travel further to school will impact:\n\nchildren’s mental and physical well-being. They are less likely to arrive at school ready to learn.\nthe city’s transport network; increasing car use and associated impacts. Car journeys are rising. They are now the second most common way to get to secondary school, after walking. They have overtaken public transport. (26% travel to secondary school by car, 20% by public transport and 50% walk). National data shows that when journeys go over two miles, car use goes up.\nlocal communities and friendship groups by breaking the link between home and the local school.\nworking families though making increasing the challenges of balancing caring and work\nhigher costs of travel where children do need to take the bus. This will either need to be funded by the council or by families, many of whom are struggling with the cost of living\n\nSEND children are likely to feel these impacts much more than others. They are unlikely to receive a higher priority under the admissions priorities. Only 7 children were admitted under ‘priority 2’ for exceptional cases in 2024, and 4 children in 2023.\nThe proposals cite research by Prof Gorard. He finds only a weak link between school disadvantage and attainment. He focuses on the effects of choosing to attend different schools, not of being forced to travel long distances. Recent detailed analysis of Brighton and Hove’s local situation by Prof Adam Dennett, shows the weak relationship disappears at concentrations of children on FSM found in Brighton and Hove schools.\nThe 20% open allocation is not the ‘marginal ballot’ proposed in the Sutton Trust paper. They suggest a random ballot just for a proportion of places at the spatial margin, with the rest allocated based on distance. Dr Ellen Greaves said at the Scrutiny Committee “There’s a case for thinking carefully about this policy in combination with the lottery tiebreaker”. The Sutton Trust also says that all unsuccessful applicants should be in the random ballot, not just those from specific areas.\nThe Social Mobility Commission found that a school’s absence rate is the best predictor of its pupil premium students’ progress. To improve the attainment of disadvantaged students, we must reduce persistent absence. This should be our top priority.\nThere is evidence that longer journey times to school are linked to higher absence rates\nFamilies are already able to choose schools outside of their catchment school. 35% of the Longhill catchment’s children attend Longhill. 47% of the BACA catchment’s children attend BACA. 57% of the PACA catchment’s children attend PACA. 72% of the Patcham catchment’s children attend Patcham. Other children have chosen to attend a different school. This might be a school in another catchment, outside Brighton and Hove, or a faith school. You can see where all the children go in the FOI data in this datasheet.\nMuch of the debate has focused on views that children in the Dorothy Stringer and Varndean catchment are all from privileged backgrounds. The catchment has a diverse social mix, with the % of children on FSM at the city average (at 29%). It already covers one of the three most deprived areas in the city. If the catchment change goes ahead, it will then cover two of the three most deprived areas: Whitehawk and Hollingdean. Children in these areas are as likely to be harmed by these proposals as those from more advantaged backgrounds.\nA PAN of 210 for Longhill is high compared to the number of students it has admitted in recent years. The last time it admitted 200 students was in 2014.\nMany of the city’s secondary schools and teachers don’t support the proposals.\nThose at the top of the tree in UK education don’t support the proposals - Sir Jon Coles (former DG UK Department for Education): 20th Jan, twitter - “Truly extraordinary proposals from @BrightonHoveCC based on some very shaky pseudo-academic evidence. Surely no-one wants a return to council-led social engineering by busing? Maybe improving the weak schools would be a better strategy…”\nThe Sutton Trust have made no institutional statement of support for these specific proposals and said “We have therefore not commented on the detail of the proposals from Brighton and Hove, as we believe that they and the local stakeholders responding to the consultation are best placed to know what will work locally”\nProf Stephen Gorard, Durham University said “Obviously it’s got to be done with the minimum of disruption. You don’t want to upset children’s one shot at education and you don’t want to have other unintended consequences that make things worse”\nDr Ellen Greaves has said to “Evaluate what happens with the free school meals policy before changing much else”\nThe consultation and scrutiny of the proposals has been inadequate, with reasonable concerns sidelined. If the Council has confidence in its proposals, why has it been so reluctant to present the full implications of its proposals or to consider other options? Serious questions have been raised about the lawfulness of the entire process.\n\n\n\nPSG views on the proposals\n\nIf these proposals go through, it will create huge uncertainty and worry for families about which school their children will attend.\nRandomly selecting children to be sent to the school’s that are furthest from where they live is bound to be unpopular. It is manifestly unfair and goes against the wishes of the city clearly expressed in the engagement exercise.\nAny policy not supported by strong evidence, with dubious gains, serious negatives and opposed by most of the city is weak policy and destined to fail – Labour voters expect better and will not forget.\nLonghill will continue to be a problem unless it is moved from its current location or supported to be a much smaller school in its current location (i.e. through federation with another school).\nPoor preparation and mismanagement of the process has led to an information vacuum which despite the best efforts of many trying to make sense of the situation, has inevitably become filled with divisive rhetoric. Wounds that have been opened and division sewn between the cities communities that could and should have been avoided. These may take some time to heal and the blame falls entirely on the council.\n\n\n\nPSG Councillor Solutions Sheet – A Road Map to a sustainable solution for the city\nWhat is the alternative? What can create a sustainable long-term, equitable solution for the city?\n\nSLOW DOWN and stop the current proposals before you cause serious damage.\nBe prepared to acknowledge mistakes have been made – people value honesty\nFind a short-term solution to buy time for a longer-term, sustainable solution that has buy-in from across the city. This sticking plaster must be a temporary patch. It should be acceptable to most. It must cover immediate issues to buy time. For example, reduce PAN at Longhill. Support a smaller size by federating with another city school. Allow access to Stringer/Varndean for Whitehawk if it’s a priority. But, do not displace children already in the catchment. If the Council wants to add more children to a catchment, it must make enough places available.\nUnderstand what the process of making good policy should look like. Take advice / carry out research on best practice in evidence-based or evidence-informed policy making and, if necessary, undergo training to avoid making the same mistakes again.\n\nBe clear about what problems you are trying to solve. Too many different issues have been bundled together in this process, and the school admissions process may not be an appropriate tool for some of the problems.\nLook into how multiple groups could be brought into the design process further down the line and the best ways for managing this\nExplore methodologies from geodesign to codesign for facilitating collective input – there are multiple examples do draw upon from domains such as health. Get expert advice on this.\n\nUnderstand your system. Commission a comprehensive piece (or pieces) of open, publicly available, reproducible research (you can start with the experts in the city and in-house in the council) which profiles the current secondary education system in the city, contextualising it with relevant national and local comparisons, including:\n\nThe spatial system of schools, pupils and their residential locations (disaggregated by relevant demographics - disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged or SEND etc.) and accessibilities – by walking and public transport in particular.\nA deep dive on the schools themselves and their recent trajectories.\n\nWhat are the profiles, strengths and weakness of each of the city’s schools (Quantitative and Qualitative)?\nWhat are their trajectories of growth/improvement, stasis or decline?\nHow do these compare locally and nationally so that we can derive a meaningful context?\nLook at what travel distances are typical in other comparable towns and cities. Consider whether people are likely to accept higher levels of uncertainty and longer travel distances than in other places, and whether it is reasonable to expect them to do so.\n\nGravity and location allocation modelling to determine the suitability of current sizes and locations of schools relative to pupil home locations now and in the future.\n\nTest scenarios for alternative or more optimal configurations\n\nA full review of alternatives to the current catchment-based system of allocation. This will require examining and modelling a range of solutions which might include\n\na return to distance-based tie-breaks, but with true marginal ballots at the margins\noverlapping catchments\nno catchments at all, but with other priorities\nand a selection of alternative methods optimised for desirable outcome such as accessibility or social mixing.\n\nCommission other specific pieces of academic research that might also be relevant (travel, attainment, disadvantage, absence), but that focus in on the City of Brighton and Hove specifically to help develop a broad understanding. Make all findings and research public and easily accessible. Feed these back into the later design stage\n\nClearly define each of your problems separately and don’t conflate them – it is likely a review may reveal priorities like:\n\np1 – Longhill financial viability, location, size, outcomes\np2 – Raising attainment\np3 – (In)accessibility of Whitehawk\n\nDecide which of these are most important – rank your priorities and design solutions separately. Don’t assume the problem is due to school admissions arrangements if there are more obvious explanations.\nDecide what theories and methods that underpin the observations of your system can be brought to bear to influence new designs to tackle each priority problem? Which ones might be most relevant to your system? Which ones might not?\nWhat models might we be able to use to try different scenarios/designs to understand what the benefits and drawbacks of the different designs there might be? Use these models to run tests and understand the potential consequences of any decisions.\nDecide what might be the best set of alternative designs to consult further on. Do this with an open mind and without preconceived ideas. Allow time for iteration and revision. What information do we need to provide in order that people can make an informed contribution to the debate?\nGather evidence, iterate, try some new designs based on the feedback. Consult properly, then maybe put forward a proposal.",
