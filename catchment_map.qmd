## Current Catchments

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=FALSE, include=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(here)

optionZ <- st_read(here("data","optionZ.geojson"))
current <- st_read(here("data","current_catchments.geojson"))
```

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=FALSE}


tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(current) +
  tm_polygons(border.col = "black", alpha = 0)




```

## Proposed Catchments

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=FALSE}

tm_shape(optionZ) +
  tm_polygons(border.col = "red", alpha = 0)
```


## Both overlaid

```{r}
tm_shape(optionZ) +
  tm_polygons(border.col = "red", alpha = 0) +
tm_shape(current) +
  tm_polygons(border.col = "black", alpha = 0)
```
